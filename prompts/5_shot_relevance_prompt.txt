Query: Was strategy did Lincoln propose to combat piracy?

Document ID: Text #: 72
Key Quote: By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce, in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to re-capture any prizes which pirates might make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts, now established by law in eastern countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities.

Query: How did Lincoln defend the Emancipation Proclamation?

Document ID: Text #: 25
Key Quote: He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual members, and his own over-mastering eloquence upon the floor, he finally secured the admission of the State. Brightly, and captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence, was a mere embellishment, or, at most, but a helping hand to his inventive genius, and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril.  After the settlement of the Missouri question, although a portion of the American people have differed with Mr. Clay, and a majority even, appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration, he seems constantly to have been regarded by all, as the man for a crisis.

Document ID: Text #: 79
Key Quote: With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.  On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil-war. All dreaded it---all sought to avert it. While the inaugeral address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war---seeking to dissol[v]e the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came.  One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part [2] of it.

3. Contextual Relevance:  In his Second Inaugural Address, Lincoln justified the Civil War as an unavoidable conflict to preserve the Union. Despite both sides wishing to avoid war, Lincoln portrayed the conflict as a necessary response to the actions of those who would rather see the nation divided or destroyed than relinquish their claim to slavery. This framing underscores the war's moral and existential dimensions, linking the fight for the Union to the broader cause of human freedom.

Query: How did Lincoln assess the strategic importance of railroalds?

Document ID: Text #: 24
Key Quote: I do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency. If he afterwards thought he had been wrong, it was right for him to change. I bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the Missouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849. But, going back a little, in point of time, our war with Mexico broke out in 1846. When Congress was about adjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control, to be used by him in the recess, if found practicable and expedient, in negociating a treaty of peace with Mexico, and acquiring some part of her territory. A bill was duly got up, for the purpose, and was progressing swimmingly, in the House of Representatives, when a member by the name of David Wilmot, a democrat from Pennsylvania, moved as an amendment ``Provided that in any territory thus acquired, there shall never be slavery.'' This is the origin of the far-famed ``Wilmot Proviso.''.
