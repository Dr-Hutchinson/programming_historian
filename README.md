## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) and other forms of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offer historians new approaches to programmatically explore the past. At their best, LLMs can recall significant volumes of historical knowledge gleaned from the vast datasets on which they are trained - at least, that's what the [data seems to indicate.](https://dr-hutchinson-what-do-ais-know-about-history-app-i3l5jo.streamlit.app/) But these tools must be used with care. AI models may possess a broad knowledge base, but their reliability for more specialized historical topics is often limited. Of greatest concern, of course, is their propensity to deliver convincingly invented fiction as historical fact.

A popular method to leverage the strengths of LLMs while mitigating their shortcomings is retrieval augmented generation (RAG). RAG is an approach that combines language generation models with information retrieval systems. This combination guides LLMs in providing contextually relevant responses informed by a specific database or text corpus.

Here is an example of such an approach using the collected speeches of Abraham Lincoln. [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/), a leading LLM from OpenAI, can offer significant details concerning Lincoln’s life and times. However, it struggles when posed a more specific and narrow question: “What did Abraham Lincoln think of Japan?”

> **GPT-4**: Abraham Lincoln's presidency (1861-1865) coincided with a period when Japan was opening up to the Western world after centuries of relative isolation under the Tokugawa shogunate's "sakoku" (closed country) policy. However, there are no direct records of Lincoln expressing specific views on Japan. His presidency was largely consumed by the American Civil War and domestic issues, which were of paramount importance to his administration…

Yet a less advanced model, [Mistral-7B](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/), provides a detailed response when supplied relevant excerpts from Lincoln’s speeches through RAG:

> **Mistral-7B**: Abraham Lincoln's views on Japan were shaped by the diplomatic challenges and opportunities that arose during his presidency.
>
> In his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln acknowledged the inconsistent and capricious nature of Japan's government and its performance of treaty obligations. Despite these challenges, he remained optimistic about the progress made through international cooperation and the positive impact of economic engagement on US-Japanese relations. He noted, "good progress has been effected by the western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed, or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan towards the United States" [(Fourth Annual Message, December 6, 1864)](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/nicolay/blob/main/data/individual_speeches_and_metadata/Text%20%23_%2072.txt).
>
> In his Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862, Lincoln mentioned Japan as one of the countries with which the US maintained favorable diplomatic and economic relations. He stated, "Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan" [(Second Annual Message, December 1, 1862)](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/nicolay/blob/main/data/individual_speeches_and_metadata/Text%20%23_%2058.txt). This passage underscores the importance of Japan as a diplomatic and economic partner during this period.
>
> However, Lincoln also recognized the challenges posed by Japan's unique political structure and the resistance of the imperial court to Westernizing policies. In his Third Annual Message on December 8, 1863, he acknowledged the serious jeopardy that US-Japanese relations had faced due to the opposition of the Japanese aristocracy to the enlightened and liberal policies of the shogun. He asked for Congress's attention to the claim of the US minister in Japan for damages sustained in the destruction of the legation residence at Yedo [(Third Annual Message, December 8, 1863)](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/nicolay/blob/main/data/individual_speeches_and_metadata/Text%20%23_%2066.txt).
>
> Overall, Lincoln's speeches reveal a nuanced understanding of Japan and its role in international affairs during his presidency. While acknowledging the challenges posed by Japan's unique political structure and inconsistent adherence to treaty obligations, he remained committed to finding diplomatic solutions and maintaining economic engagement to strengthen US-Japanese relations.

While GPT-4 is a superior model in terms of its training and "knowledge", the smaller model employing RAG provides an informed response supported by accurate quotes and specific citations drawn from the Lincoln corpus. More importantly, this response is supported by a chain of evidence that allows users to verify for themselves the validity of the AI response. While this approach does not eliminate the possibility of AI errors and “hallucinations,” this method enables the transformation of simple keyword searches into dialogues with data, an intriguing approach to historical inquiry.

This lesson for the *Programming Historian* creates a similar RAG application using the collected speeches of Abraham Lincoln to demonstate how RAG works and how historians can create their own personalized RAG applications. It is based on [*Nicolay: Exploring the Speeches of Abraham Lincoln with AI*](https://nicolay-honestabes-info.streamlit.app/), a digital history project utilizing a similar RAG approach.

The lesson will cover the following elements:

* How RAG works
* Preparing datasets for RAG applications
* Common RAG search methods
* Prompting Large Language Models for RAG
* Evaluating RAG
* Advanced RAG: For Further Exploration

**Suggested Prior Skills**

Familiarity with Python is recommended for this lesson. Specifically, it would be beneficial to understand how to load and index files, set variables, employ external libraries, and manipulate text strings. The [*Programming Historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/?topic=python&sortType=difficulty&sortOrder=desc) offers a variety of helpful lessons on these Python approaches.

This lesson also assumes familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks. If you are unfamiliar with this format, you may find the [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks) lesson a valuable resource.

Readers are particularly encouraged to use a Notebook enabled for cloud-based GPU access, like the [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) environment, which offers users free access to processors needed for execution of some elements of this notebook. [The Computer Vision for the Humanities (Part 1)](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/computer-vision-deep-learning-pt1) lesson offers a guide for getting started with Colab.

## How RAG Works

{% include figure.html filename="naive_rag_image.png" alt="Diagram illustrating a basic RAG workflow" caption="Figure 1: A basic RAG workflow. From Gao et. al, \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey.\" arXiv:2312.10997v4  [cs.CL]  5 Jan 2024. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997)" %}

Retrieval augmented generation was [first introduced](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) in 2020, and has developed into an active research area for generative AI. While RAG apps vary in complexity and scale, RAG applications typically use the following features: data indexing, a retriever, and a large language model.

**Data Indexing:** Data indexing is the foundational step in the RAG process. This process involves organizing and storing data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, transforming a dataset into a knowledge base for the application. This is accomplished by programmatically segmenting and indexing the data for search and retrieval.

**Retriever:** Retrievers are used to search over a dataset. When given a user query, retrievers seek out data that most closely matches the query. Retrievers contain modular elements, and different search methods can be implemented based on user preference. Keyword matching using methods typical of standard search engines, for example, is a common search approach. However, keyword search alone can fail to capture documents with similar meanings but employing different terminology. Accordingly, RAG applications typically utilize hybrid search approaches to capture these nuances. Methods such as [text embedding](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/understanding-creating-word-embeddings) enable capacities for semantic and contextual search approaches, broadening the retriever's scope while also enhancing its precision. Using these approaches, the retriever captures the top-ranked results to pass on to an LLM to interpret.

**Large Language Model (LLM):** An LLM is the final component of a RAG system. LLMs are trained on vast corpora of text data, enabling them to imitate forms of human understanding and generate text and working code. Their training gives them considerable recall in a vast array of domains. Yet they also are prone to invent misinformation and make erroneous claims. By integrating a retriever, an LLM can enhance its responses with specific, contextually relevant information from the indexed dataset. Its responses can be further improved by the use of prompts containing example RAG tasks, allowing the LLM to utilize its capacities for in-context learning. This combination leverages the broad knowledge and language capabilities of the LLM while grounding its responses from a specific dataset.

## Developing a RAG App: Things to Consider

{% include figure.html filename="Open_Rag_Diagram_1.png" alt="Flowchart illustrating an open-source RAG workflow" caption="Figure 2: An open-source RAG workflow." %}

This lesson will guide you through building your own open-source RAG application. In exploring RAG techniques, historians should consider their use case, their data, and the costs and technical knowledge needed to implement a RAG app.  Careful consideration of these factors at the onset will save time and expense later.

The easiest path is to utilize RAG as a service, where data is uploaded to a cloud for retrieval and interpretation by closed-source models. Weaviate’s [Verba](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba) service, for example, offers a technically accessible platform for utilizing a wide array of RAG-approaches and API access to most advanced LLMs.

However, open-source approaches offer an important alternative to RAG as a service. While proprietary models offered by firms like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic offer state-of-the-art performance, the expense of using them can scale quickly. Open-source LLMs offer a no-cost, locally hosted alternative. Moreover,  open-source models are quickly advancing in terms of performance and accessibility. Perhaps most importantly, open-source methods open up the possibility to develop customizable RAG frameworks tailored to specific research tasks.

To be sure, there are challenges in utilizing open-source approaches. Running local models often requires access to high-powered GPU processors or external hosting services, which bear their own costs. However, services like Google Colabs have enabled significant access to cloud-based GPU computing power.

In considering these different options, consider what elements from the chart below best fit with your use needs:

Table 1: Open Source vs. Closed Source Models for RAG

A final element to consider are specialized frameworks for RAG programming. Python libraries for LLMs such as [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [Llamaindex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index), and [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) feature tutorials and Jupyter Notebooks for building different RAG approaches and LLM applications.

## Preparing Datasets for RAG

RAG systems work best when tailored to the specific data you wish to explore. An important first step is indexing your data for effective recall and interpretation. One crucial element is addressing the “context windows” of LLMs, or the limit of the textual information the model can process in a single inference. While some models possess expansive windows that can take in entire datasets in a single query, many models remain limited to a few pages of text.

Text chunking, or splitting large text collections into smaller individual segments, is a common workaround to this limitation. For example, the data used in this lesson comes from a corpus of Lincoln speeches held by the [University of Virginia’s Miller Center](https://data.millercenter.org./). This collection of fifteen Lincoln speeches totals some 96,000 words, or some 300 pages of text, too large for most open-source models. Accordingly, the corpus has been broken down into 79 individual chunks formatted into a [JSON file](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/nicolay/blob/main/data/lincoln_speech_corpus.json). A good way to observe this process is by exploring [ChunkViz](https://example.com), a web tool for visualizing how text splitters chunk a text based on different settings. A number of LLM programming frameworks can automate this chunking process across a variety of data formats and programming languages. Frameworks such as [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/#text-splitters), [Llamaindex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/node_parsers/token_text_splitter/), and [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/10_Extract_text_from_documents.ipynb) offer text splitters/chunkers for effective data indexing.

Another approach to preparing datasets for RAG is the inclusion of metadata accompanying each text segment. Metadata can provide additional details to aid search-and-retrieval and provide context for the LLM’s interpretations. If such metadata is unavailable, one approach is to programmatically generate metadata using an LLM. For example, this [prompt](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/programming_historian/blob/main/prompts/metadata_generation_prompt.txt) demonstrates how this method was used on the Lincoln corpus to generate summaries and extract keywords from each chunk. This metadata is then paired with the Lincoln corpus to facilitate retrieval and interpretation.

The code below demonstrates how to download and view the data structure of Lincoln corpus. Only the 'full_text' and 'source' variables are originally part of the Lincoln corpus; the 'summary' and 'keywords' variables were programmatically created with LLMs and later added.

## Common RAG Search Methods

{% include figure.html filename="Open_Rag_Diagram_1.png" alt="Flowchart illustrating an open-source RAG workflow" caption="Figure 2: An open-source RAG workflow." %}

Building a retriever, or a set of search methods, is the next step after data indexing. In these examples, we explore search approaches commonly used in RAG applications and then combine them to search the Lincoln corpus. In the code below, we will construct a retriever system employing four types of retrieval tools:

1.  **Keyword search (using BM25)**
2.  **Text Embeddings for Semantic Similarity (using Qdrant)**
3.  **Text Embeddings for Contextual Similarity (using ColBERT)**
4.  **Search Result Reranker (BGE-Base)**

You can follow along and replicate these steps with this [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/programming_historian/blob/main/Hutchinson_draft_1.ipynb), which enables remote access to a GPU needed to run the code.

To begin, let’s download and import the libraries needed for the RAG app. Please note that some of these libraries are sizable and may take some time to download and install (approximately five to ten minutes).

<pre>
1.0 - Installing dependencies

!pip install -U pyarrow==14.0.2 requests==2.31.0 packaging==24.1

# Then install the rest of the dependencies
!pip install langchain_community tiktoken langchain-openai langchainhub chromadb langchain youtube-transcript-api pytube
!pip install jq
!pip install -U ragatouille
!pip install -U FlagEmbedding
!pip install -U transformers
!pip install qdrant-client>=1.1.1
!pip install -U sentence-transformers
!pip install nltk
!pip install ctransformers>=0.2.27
!pip install -q -U accelerate
!pip install -q -U bitsandbytes
!pip install secure-smtplib
!pip install rank-bm25
!pip install rouge-score
</pre>

Next, let’s ensure access to [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), an online repository of downloadable open-source models that we’ll be using to construct this RAG application. The code below sets up API access to HuggingFace; you can sign up for an API key [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/en/quicktour#get-your-api-token). While HuggingFace does offer paid tiers for some services, all of the models used in this lesson are free to use and download.

<pre>
1.1 - Setting HuggingFace API key

from huggingface_hub import login

# Set you API key here
hf_token = "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY"

# Login to Hugging Face
login(hf_token)
</pre>

### Keyword Search (with BM25)

[BM25](https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25), short for "Best Matching 25", is a Python library that uses a set of ranking functions to estimate the relevance of documents to a given query. BM25 ranks documents based on the occurrence of query terms within each document. This approach is computationally efficient and relatively easy to implement. However, BM25 relies on exact term matching and may miss relevant documents that use different terms to express similar concepts. That said, it offers a good baseline for initial searches.

The code below demonstrates how this search method is implemented:

**1. Library Imports and Setup:**

Imports necessary libraries: The code imports libraries for BM25 (`rank_bm25`), sentence encoding (`SentenceTransformer`), text processing (`nltk`), and data loading (`langchain_community`).

**2. Initialize Sentence Encoder:**

Sets up a Sentence Transformer model downloaded from HuggingFace to encode sentences in the Lincoln corpus.

**3. Download and Prepare NLTK Resources:**

Download required [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK) resources: The code downloads the 'punkt' and 'stopwords' datasets, which are needed for tokenizing text and filtering out common stopwords (e.g., "the," "and," "is").

**4. Define Metadata Extraction and Preprocessing Functions:**

*   **Extract Metadata:** The `extract_metadata_for_bm25` function extracts relevant metadata from each document, such as text ID, full text, summary, and keywords.
*   **Preprocess Text:** The code defines a preprocessing function that tokenizes the text, converts it to lowercase, and removes stopwords, preparing it for BM25 indexing.

**5. Load and Encode Documents:**

*   **Load Documents:** The `load_and_encode_documents_bm25` function loads the Lincoln speech corpus from a JSON file using [Langchain's JSONLoader.](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/json/)
*   **Encode Texts for BM25:** The function preprocesses each document and creates a BM25 index of the corpus for keyword search. Notably, for this code, we include not just the full text of each Lincoln speech but also the accompanying metadata, such as summaries and keyword lists.

**6. Perform Keyword Search with BM25:**

*   **Keyword Search Function:** The `keyword_search_bm25` function takes a query, processes it, and calculates BM25 scores for each document in the corpus based on the query.

**7. Find Best Key Quote:**

The `find_best_key_quote` function identifies the most relevant passage in each document that matches the query terms.

**8. Return Search Results:**

*   **Compile Results:** The keyword search function compiles the top matching documents into a Pandas DataFrame, including details like document ID, source, summary, keywords, BM25 score, and the most relevant quote from each document.

Table 2: BM25 Keyword Search Results

As the search results demonstrate, we see the three Annual Messages displayed, with the mentions of 'Japan' highlighted in yellow in the 'Key Quote', 'Summary', and 'Keywords' columns. Other terms in the query, such as 'Lincoln' and 'regard', are also highlighted, demonstrating how extraenous terms in a search can create noise and potentially crowd out relevant matches.

While keyword search is effective for many types of queries, adding additional methods will make the Retriever more robust. In the next section we'll explore one such method, semantic search with text embeddings.

## Semantic Search (with Qdrant)

Semantic search aims to improve search relevance by understanding the meaning of words and phrases rather than relying solely on keyword matching. For this, we use text embeddings, which transforms text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.

For this lesson, we are using the ['all-MiniLM-L6-v2'](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model, which is an open-source, lightweight embedding model from the [Sentence Transformer](https://sbert.net/) library. [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) is a framework for locally using this model to convert text to embeddings and store them in a vector database for querying. As interest in RAG and LLMs has expanded, intense competition has emerged between services offering text embedding and semantic search. [This leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) from HuggingFace offers a quick rundown of leading embedding models.

The code below demonstrates how the semantic search process is implemented:

**1. Download and Prepare Qdrant and Sentence Transformer:**

This section installs and imports necessary libraries for semantic search. Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine that we use to store and query text embeddings. Sentence Transformers from HuggingFace provide pre-trained models to create these embeddings.

**2. Define Custom Stopwords:**

Custom stopwords are defined to remove common but irrelevant words from queries, ensuring better focus on meaningful terms. The term "Lincoln" has been excluded here, as its presence was found to distort search results. Repeated testing over known texts/queries can help determine whether particular search terms should be excluded.

**3. Metadata Extraction and Document Encoding:**

Metadata is extracted for each document and encoded. Unlike in keyword search, for this approach, we will only include the full text of the Lincoln corpus, but not the rest of the corpus metadata.

**4. Perform Semantic Search with Qdrant:**

Using Qdrant, we search for documents that are semantically similar to the query, using a process called cosine similarity.

**5. Compile and Display Search Results:**

The search results include documents with their semantic scores, most relevant quotes, sources, summaries, and keywords. We also identify similar words within the documents to highlight how they relate to the query.

Table 3: Semantic Keyword Search Results

In the results above we can see the terms identified by Qdrant as possessing greatest semantic similaritiy. The different colors reflect the varying degree of semantic similariity with the query, offering a set of results utilizing terms as varied as "sacred", "belief", "faith", "prayers", "consecreated", "God", and "Bible".

In our final search method, we'll explore how to augment semantic search with contextual search using ColBERT.

## Contextual Search (with ColBERT)

[ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT) is a retrieval model designed to enhance RAG applications by capturing the contextual relationships between query terms and document terms. Unlike traditional keyword matching or semantic search, ColBERT allows for a more nuanced understanding of context. For instance, in a historical document, the term "state" could refer to a political entity or a condition of being. ColBERT can calculate the difference by analyzing surrounding words and phrases, offering more precise and granular search results. ColBERT has also been trained on multilingual text collections, making it particularly attractive for diverse datasets.

For implementing ColBERT, we'll use the [RAGatouille](https://github.com/bclavie/ragatouille) library to load this model to implement RAG tasks. RAGatouille builds a custom index of the corpus for search and retrieval. The initial process of building an index takes some time (approximately five minutes for this corpus), but once the index has been created, subsequent searches run quite quickly, and the index can be saved for reuse.

The code below demonstrates how ColBERT is implemented with RAGatouille:

**1. Download and Prepare the Model and Data**
Install and import the necessary libraries. Custom functions are defined to preprocess the text and query, ensuring that common but irrelevant words (stopwords) are removed to improve the focus of the search.

**2. Metadata Extraction and Document Encoding**
The `extract_metadata_for_colbert` function extracts relevant metadata from each document and combines the full text, summary, and keywords for indexing. This is similar to the preprocessing steps for BM25 and Qdrant.

**3. Loading and Encoding Documents**
The documents are loaded and encoded using a Sentence Transformer model. This involves converting the text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning.

**4. Setting Up ColBERT with RAGatouille**
RAGatouille is the library for using ColBERT and simplifies the setup of ColBERT by providing utilities for training, fine-tuning, and indexing.

**5. Performing Contextual Search**
The `rag_search_with_scores` function performs a search using the ColBERT model. It preprocesses the query, retrieves the most relevant documents, and finds the best matching sentences within each document.

        <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word;">Summary: In Abraham Lincoln's July 4 Message to Congress in 1861, he discusses the difficult decision-making process surrounding the events at Fort Sumter. Abandoning the fort was seen as ruinous, as it would discourage Union supporters, embolden adversaries, and potentially lead to foreign recognition of the Confederacy. Lincoln explains that reinforcing Fort Pickens was prioritized to demonstrate the government's resolve. He emphasizes that the assault on Fort Sumter was not an act of self-defense by the assailants, as the government's intentions were merely to maintain visible possession of the fort to preserve the Union. The conflict at Fort Sumter forced the country to face the issue of immediate dissolution or bloodshed, which also raised questions about the viability of a constitutional republic in maintaining territorial integrity against domestic foes.</td>

He refers to a statement by Stephen Douglas and uses it as a starting point for examining the actions of the founding fathers, who framed the Constitution, on this matter. By analyzing their votes in the Congress of the Confederation and the first Congress under the Constitution, Lincoln shows that many of the founding fathers believed the Federal Government could control slavery in federal territories.</td>

          I say this is the leading principle---the sheet anchor of American republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence says: ``We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.'' <mark style="background-color: #F88379;">I have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to our ancient faith, the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed.</mark>

He asserts that the concept of self-government is fundamentally right but questions its application to the issue of slavery. Lincoln argues that true self-government cannot exist when one person governs another without consent. He cites the Declaration of Independence as the basis of this belief, stating that the just powers of governments come from the consent of the governed. He clarifies that he is not advocating for political and social equality between whites and blacks, but rather arguing against the extension of slavery into new territories. Finally, he discusses the opinions and examples of the founding fathers, asserting that their support for self-government did not extend to carrying slavery into new territories.</td>

### Combined Search: Set Query

In developing a Retriever with a variety of search approaches, we now need to integrate all these methods into a single search process. We will then apply the final element, a reranker, which will order the results for passing on to a LLM.

Let's return to our original query concerning Lincoln's views on Japan.

<pre>
1.11 - Combined Search: Set Query

query = "How did Lincoln regard Japan?"

## Reranking Search Results (with BGE-Base)

We now have a collection of results for our query from our various search methods. To determine which results are the most relevant, we'll utilize the [BGE-Base reranker](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-base). This lightweight model can be locally downloaded from HuggingFace. It possesses capabilities in both English and Mandarin ([a larger version](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3) possesses a greater range of multilingual abilities). As with text embedding and semantic search, there is intense competition in this domain. This [HuggingFace leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) offers other notable reranking models. Of particular note, the author recommends [Cohere's Rerank](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/overview) model, which offers a high-performing, multilingual model via an API service.

The following code demonstrates how to download and use the BGE-Base reranker model:

**1. Download and Prepare the Model:**
Download the BGE-Base reranker model and its tokenizer from HuggingFace.

**2. Prepare the Input Pairs:**
Create pairs of queries and the corresponding search results ("Key Quotes") from our combined search results. These pairs are fed into the reranker to assess their relevance.

**3. Tokenize the Input Pairs:**
The pairs are tokenized, or converting the text into a format that the model can process.

**4. Compute Reranking Scores:**
Using the model, we compute the logits (raw prediction scores) for each query-result pair. These logits serve as the reranking scores, indicating the relevance of each result to the query.

**5. Sort and Rank the Results:**
The scores are added to the combined results DataFrame, and the results are sorted in descending order based on their reranking scores. The highest-ranked results are the most relevant to the query.

Table 5: BGE-Reranker Results

Here we can see the retriver successfully found the three instances were Japan is mentioned in the Lincoln corpus (texts 58, 66, and 72). However, the multiple search methods have also resulted in duplicate results, which could potentially crowd out other relevant matches. The final element in sorting these results is deduplication and final ranking via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

## Deduplicate and Rank Results Using RRF Scoring

When utilizing multiple search methods in a RAG system, it is common to encounter overlapping results. Different methods might return the same documents or segments due to their relevance to the query. To avoid redundancy and ensure a diverse set of responses, deduplication is essential. This step ensures that each unique result appears only once in the final output, enhancing the clarity and utility of the search results.

The inclusion of Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) adds further precision to the search process. This technique combines the rankings from multiple search methods into a single, unified ranking. The core idea is to reward documents that consistently rank highly across different search methods. RRF calculates a combined score for each document by considering its rank from each method, giving higher scores to documents that are frequently ranked at the top. This approach helps in aggregating the strengths of various retrieval methods, producing a more accurate and relevant set of final results.

The following code demonstrates how to deduplicate and rank search results using RRF scoring:

**1. Initialize DataFrame:** The combined results from all search methods are stored in a DataFrame.

**2. Deduplicate Results:** The DataFrame is sorted by the reranking score, and duplicates are removed based on the document ID.

**3. Calculate RRF Scores:** For each document, the code calculates the RRF score by considering its rank from each search method (BM25, Qdrant, and ColBERT).

**4. Rank and Sort Results:** The results are sorted in descending order based on their RRF scores, ensuring that the most relevant documents appear at the top.

**5. Save and Display Results:** The final ranked results are saved locally to a CSV file and displayed in a structured format.

## Prompting LLMs for RAG: Selecting a Model

When considering LLMs for RAG applications, it is crucial to select an appropriate model that fits your needs for performance and available memory usage. This section will guide you through key considerations when selecting open-source LLMs and demonstrate how to load and quantize a model to optimize resource usage.

### Selecting Open-Source LLMs

Just as a historian carefully selects the most appropriate archival source for their research, choosing the right Large Language Model (LLM) is crucial for a successful RAG application. LLMs, the engines driving the interpretive power of RAG, come in a variety of sizes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Consider these factors when making your selection:

**Performance:** Larger models, trained on vast datasets, generally offer superior understanding and generation capabilities. They excel at complex tasks, grasping nuanced language and generating more sophisticated text. However, this performance comes at a cost.

**Memory Usage:** Large LLMs, with their billions of parameters, consume significant amounts of computer memory. Running these models locally often requires specialized hardware with powerful GPUs, which can be expensive and inaccessible to many researchers.

**Inference Speed:** The sheer size of large LLMs can also lead to slower processing times. Generating responses and completing tasks can take longer, potentially hindering the research workflow.

**Resource Requirements:** The computational demands of large LLMs necessitate substantial resources. Researchers may need to invest in expensive hardware or rely on cloud-based computing services, which can incur significant costs.

To navigate these trade-offs, it's helpful to think of LLMs in terms of familiar research resources:

**Large LLMs:** These are akin to comprehensive encyclopedias, possessing vast knowledge and capable of generating highly sophisticated text. However, like physical encyclopedias, they require significant space (memory) and can be cumbersome to navigate (slow processing). Examples include [Llama-3-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) and [Cohere's Command-R-Plus](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus).

**Medium-Sized LLMs:** These are like specialized textbooks, offering a good balance between knowledge and efficiency. They are suitable for most RAG applications and can run on more readily available computers. Think of them as focused resources, providing in-depth knowledge on specific subjects without overwhelming your workspace. [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) is a good example of this category.

**Small LLMs:** These are like concise dictionaries, ideal for specific tasks and limited computing power. They are fast and efficient but may lack the depth of knowledge of larger models. Like a pocket dictionary, they are portable and readily accessible, perfect for quick lookups and targeted tasks. [Phi-2B](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) and [Gemma-2B](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b) are examples of smaller, more efficient LLMs.

For this lesson, we'll be using the medium-sized [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2). It offers a good balance between performance and resource requirements.

The code below demonstrates how to download, load, and quantize the Mistral-7B model. This process requires access to a GPU processor and can take some time to complete (around five minutes).

**1. Import Necessary Libraries:**

*   `AutoTokenizer`: Used to handle tokenization of the input text.
*   `AutoModelForCausalLM`: Used to load the language model.
*   `Pipeline`: Provides an easy-to-use interface for various tasks like text generation.

**2. Define the Model Name:**

`model_name` is set to the identifier of the Mistral 7B model hosted on HuggingFace.

**3. Initialize Global Variable:**

`mistral_pipe` is initialized as `None` to hold the model pipeline once it is loaded.

**4. Define Function to Load and Quantize the Model:**

*   **Check if the Model is Already Loaded:** The function checks if the `mistral_pipe` is already initialized to avoid redundant loading. This is key, as repeated loading will severely impact available working memory.
*   **Loading and Quantizing:** If the model is not already loaded, it initializes the tokenizer and loads the model with 4-bit quantization (`load_in_4bit=True`). It sets the data type to `torch.bfloat16` and uses `device_map="auto"` to automatically distribute the model across available devices.
*   **Pipeline Creation:** The function creates a text-generation pipeline using the quantized model and tokenizer.

**5. Load the Mistral LLM Model:**

The function `load_and_quantize_model` is called to load and quantize the Mistral 7B model. The resulting pipeline is stored in the `mistral_pipe` variable.

<pre>
2.0 - Load and Quantize Mistral-7B LLM

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline

# LLM Model
model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"

# Global variable to hold the loaded pipeline once initialized
mistral_pipe = None

# Function to load and quantize the model
def load_and_quantize_model(model_name):
    global mistral_pipe

    # Check if the model pipeline is already loaded
    if mistral_pipe is not None:
        print("Using already loaded model.")
        return mistral_pipe

    # Proceed to load and quantize the model if not already loaded
    print("Loading and quantizing model...")
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        load_in_4bit=True,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        device_map="auto",
        trust_remote_code=True,
    )

    mistral_pipe = pipeline(
        "text-generation",
        model=model,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        device_map="auto"
    )

    print("Model loaded!")
    return mistral_pipe

# Load Mistral LLM Model
mistral_pipe = load_and_quantize_model(model_name)
</pre>

## Prompting Mistral-7B

Speaking the Language of LLMs: The Art of Prompting

Having selected our LLM, we now need to learn how to communicate with it effectively. This is where prompting comes in - a set of instructions that guides the LLM in generating text. LLMs are remarkably capable, but they truly excel when given clear directions and examples to guide their outputs. A well-crafted prompt provides this guidance, shaping the LLM's response and ensuring it aligns with the user's goals.

Imagine asking an LLM, "Tell me about Abraham Lincoln." Without further guidance, the model might generate a generic biography, pulling from its vast knowledge base. But if we provide a more specific prompt, such as "Analyze Lincoln's views on slavery as expressed in his Second Inaugural Address," we direct the LLM's attention to a particular aspect of Lincoln's life and thought, resulting in a more focused and insightful response.

Prompting is an art as much as a science. It involves understanding the LLM's capabilities, tailoring instructions to its strengths, and experimenting with different approaches to achieve desired outcomes. To learn more about prompting approaches, I highly recommend exploring the [Prompt Engineering Guide by DAIR.AI.](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)

Mistral-7B's Unique Language

Mistral-7B, like many LLMs, has its own preferred "language" for prompts. It uses specific instruction formats, including prefixes and suffixes that must be included in every generation. Think of these as the grammatical rules that ensure the LLM understands our requests.

**Instruction Formatting:**

In using Mistral 7B, your prompt must be enclosed within the `[INST]` and `[/INST]` variables. The first instruction should begin with a beginning-of-sentence token (`<s>`), while subsequent instructions should not.

The following section demonstrates how to prompt the Mistral-7B model to answer a specific question. Here, we use a simple query regarding Abraham Lincoln's term as president to illustrate the process. The function `generate_response` is used to send the prompt to the model and retrieve the generated response.

**1. Import the Pipeline:**

We import the `pipeline` from the `transformers` library. This pipeline is used to handle the text generation process.

**2. Define the Prompt:**

The `prompt` variable is set to include the query within the required instruction format for Mistral-7B. It begins with `<s> [INST]` and ends with `[/INST]`.

**3. Define the `generate_response` Function:**

The `generate_response` function takes two parameters: `query` and `pipe`. The `query` is the user's question, and `pipe` is the Mistral model pipeline.

**4. Send the Prompt:** The function sends the prompt to the model using the `pipe`. The `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, and `repetition_penalty` parameters control the text generation process:

*   `max_new_tokens=250`: Limits the number of tokens in the generated response. This can be adjusted upwards for longer responses at the cost of inference speed.
*   `temperature=0.0`: Controls the randomness of the generated text. A lower temperature results in more deterministic outputs; higher settings result in more creative but potentially less accurate results.
*   `repetition_penalty=1.15`: Penalizes repeated words and phrases to ensure diverse responses.

**5. Extract the Answer:** The generated text is extracted and split by the `[/INST]` delimiter. The relevant portion of the response is then stripped of any extra whitespace and returned.

**6. Generate the Initial Answer:**

The `generate_response` function is called with the `query` and `mistral_pipe` to generate the initial answer. The response is then displayed.

<pre>
2.2 - Sample Prompt

from transformers import pipeline

prompt = "&lt;s&gt;[INST] When did Lincoln serve as president? [/INST]"

def generate_response(query, pipe):
    response = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=250, temperature=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.15, num_return_sequences=1)
    initial_answer = response[0]['generated_text'].split('[/INST]')[-1].strip()
    return initial_answer

# Generate the initial answer
response = generate_response(query, mistral_pipe)
print("Response:", response)
</pre>

<pre>
2.3 - Output:

Response: Abraham Lincoln served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 to 1865.
</pre>

## How to Prompt with RAG Search Results

In the context of RAG, we need to provide the Mistral model with a prompt to reflect the data structure of the search results and specific instructions for how to carry out our task.

**Prompt Structure for RAG:**

*   **Initialization:** Start with the `<s>` token followed by the `[INST]` token.
*   **Prompts:** This variable holds detailed instructions for completing the RAG task. We'll cover this in the next section.
*   **Query:** The query used to generate RAG results.
*   **Document Details:** Data from the RAG results, such as Document ID, Key Quote, Source, and RRF Score.
*   **Document Relevance:** This is the end spot of the prompt and the place where the model's output begins on the assigned task, which is determining each document's relevance. This task is outlined in the next section.
*   **Closing:** End the instruction with the `[/INST]` token.

The prompt for each document is constructed as follows:

<pre>
mistral_prompt = f"&lt;s&gt;[INST] {prompts}\n\n" \
                 f"Query: {query}\n\n" \
                 f"Document ID: {document_id}\n" \
                 f"Key Quote: {key_quote}\n" \
                 f"Source: {source}\n" \
                 f"Total Relevance Score: {total_relevance_score}\n\n" \
                 f"1. Document Relevance: " \
                 f"[/INST]"
</pre>

The code below sets this prompt for Mistral to perform RAG tasks:

**1. Function Definition:**

The function `generate_with_mistral` takes four arguments: `deduplicated_df` (the DataFrame with search results), `query` (the user query), `pipe` (the Mistral model pipeline), and `prompts` (additional prompts for the model).

**2. Iterate Over Search Results:**

The function iterates over each row in the `deduplicated_df` DataFrame, extracting relevant information such as `document_id`, `key_quote`, `source`, and `total_relevance_score`.

**3. Craft the Mistral Prompt:**

The prompt is constructed using the instruction format, including the user query, document details, and relevance score. The prompt is enclosed within `<s>[INST]` and `[/INST]` tokens.

**4. Generate Response:**

The `pipe` (Mistral model pipeline) is used to generate a response based on the crafted prompt. Parameters such as `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, and `repetition_penalty` control the generation behavior.

**5. Extract and Clean Response:**

The generated text is processed to extract the relevant part after the `[/INST]` token. If the delimiter is not found, the entire generated text is used.

**6. Append and Print Outputs:**

The cleaned response is appended to the `mistral_outputs` list and printed for review.

**7. Update DataFrame with Mistral Outputs:**

The `deduplicated_df` DataFrame is updated with the generated responses in a new column "Mistral Output".

<pre>
2.4 - Prompting Mistral for RAG tasks

# Function to generate responses using Mistral LLM model
def generate_with_mistral(deduplicated_df, query, pipe, prompts):
    mistral_outputs = []
    for index, row in deduplicated_df.iterrows():
        document_id = row['Document ID']
        key_quote = row['Key Quote']
        source = row['Source']
        total_relevance_score = row['RRF']

        mistral_prompt = f"&lt;s&gt;[INST] {prompts}\n\n" \
                         f"Query: {query}\n\n" \
                         f"Document ID: {document_id}\n" \
                         f"Key Quote: {key_quote}\n" \
                         f"Source: {source}\n" \
                         f"Total Relevance Score: {total_relevance_score}\n\n" \
                         f"1. Document Relevance: " \
                         f"[/INST]"

        response = pipe(mistral_prompt, max_new_tokens=500, temperature=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.15, num_return_sequences=1)
        generated_text = response[0]['generated_text']

        # Extract the text after [/INST] delimiter if it exists
        if '[/INST]' in generated_text:
            # Split the output on '[/INST]' and take the part after it
            parts = generated_text.split('[/INST]')
            clean_text = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ""
        else:
            clean_text = generated_text  # Fallback if the delimiter isn't found

        mistral_outputs.append(clean_text)

        # Print the cleaned generated text for review
        print(f"Generated for Document ID {document_id}: {clean_text}")

    deduplicated_df['Mistral Output'] = mistral_outputs
    return deduplicated_df
</pre>

## Developing Prompt Instructions for RAG Tasks

Having set up a prompt structure for the LLM to process our RAG results, we now need to provide instructions on how to carry out a specific analytical task.

For this lesson, we'll set the task as relevance determination, or judging if the RAG search result is relevant to the user query. This task is useful for filtering out irrelevant results, a key element of any RAG application. But there are other benefits to including this step in your pipeline, like data collection. For example, we can prompt the LLM when it encounters a relevant result to extract the most salient excerpt from the text and offer a statement explaining its contextual relevance to the query. This data can then be used in downstream RAG tasks like text summarization and enable evaluation of the RAG pipeline itself. (See Evaluating RAG section)

To ensure consistent performance, we utilize a set of curated examples to guide a LLM in completing this task. This approach is called few-shot prompting. This method is quite effective when paired with detailed instructions on how to complete a task and accompanied by a diverse set of examples. In implementing this approach, careful selection and testing of prompts is critical to achieve desired performance. [This guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) on few-shot prompting from [DAIR.AI](https://github.com/dair-ai) is an excellent introduction to learning this practice.

Relevance determination is an example of a modular analytical task that can be added to RAG pipelines for specific and customized inquiries. Such tasks could include forms of natural language processing, OCR cleanup, creation of knowledge graphs, language translation, and facilitating multimodal RAG with computer vision.

The code below demonstrates how to download and display a collection of prompts used to guide the LLM for this task:

**1. Function to Download Data:**

The `download_data` function downloads data from the project Github URL and saves it to a text file. It checks the HTTP response status to ensure the download is successful.

**2. Specify Data and File Paths:**

The URL of the prompt file is specified, along with the directory and filename where the prompt will be saved.

**3. Download the Prompt:**

The `download_data` function is called to download the prompt from the specified URL and save it to the defined file path.

**4. Function to Read the Prompt Content:**

The `read_prompt` function reads the content of the downloaded file and returns it as a string.

**5. Read and Display the Prompt Content:**

The `read_prompt` function is called to read the content of the downloaded prompt file, and the content is printed for review.

<pre>

Key Quote: By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce, in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to re-capture any prizes which pirates might make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts, now established by law in eastern countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities.

Query: How did Lincoln defend the Emancipation Proclamation?

Document ID: Text #: 25
Key Quote: He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual members, and his own over-mastering eloquence upon the floor, he finally secured the admission of the State. Brightly, and captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence, was a mere embellishment, or, at most, but a helping hand to his inventive genius, and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril.  After the settlement of the Missouri question, although a portion of the American people have differed with Mr. Clay, and a majority even, appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration, he seems constantly to have been regarded by all, as the man for a crisis.

Key Quote: With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.  On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil-war. All dreaded it---all sought to avert it. While the inaugeral address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war---seeking to dissol[v]e the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came.  One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part [2] of it.

## Determining Relevance of RAG Results with Mistral

With the prompt structure and instructions now set, we can now test Mistral's abilities to determine which RAG results are relevant to the query. The code below runs each of the RAG results through Mistral using the prompt template.

The code below describes how this is achieved:

**1. Load Example Prompts:**

The variable `prompts` is assigned the content of the prompt loaded from the file. This prompt content includes the few-shot examples and instructions necessary for the LLM to perform the relevance determination task.

**2. Generate Responses Using Mistral LLM:**

The `generate_with_mistral` function is called with the DataFrame containing the final RAG results (`final_results_df`), the user query (`query`), the Mistral model pipeline (`mistral_pipe`), and the prompts (`prompts`). This function processes each search result and generates a relevance determination response using the Mistral-7B model.

**3. Save Final Results with Mistral Outputs to CSV:**

The resulting DataFrame, now containing the relevance determination outputs from Mistral, is saved to a CSV file named `final_results_with_mistral.csv`. The file is saved in the specified directory (`/content/`).

**4. Display the Final DataFrame with Mistral Outputs:**

The first few rows of the DataFrame with Mistral outputs are converted to HTML and displayed. This allows for a quick visual inspection of the generated results.

**5. Display a Message Indicating the Results are Saved:**

A message is printed to confirm that the final results with Mistral outputs have been saved to the specified CSV file.

Table 8: Final Results with Mistral Outputs

## Filtering Relevant Results

Above we can see how Mistral performed on evaluating the RAG results. The LLM correctly identified texts 58, 66, and 72 as relevant to the query. Likewise, the remainder of the results are correctly ranked as irrelevant. In the evaluation section of this lesson, we'll evaluate the overall accuracy of Mistral for this RAG task. But for now, we'll pass on the results identified as relevant for further evaluation by the LLM.

The code below describes how to implement this:

**1. Filter Relevant Results:**

The DataFrame `final_results_df_with_mistral` is filtered to retain only the rows where the 'Mistral Output' column contains the word "Relevant". The `str.contains` method is used to perform this string matching, with `na=False` to handle any missing values gracefully.

**2. Limit Number of Relevant Results:**

In constrained memory environments, passing on a large number of relevant results can degrade the quality of summarizations, and more critically, cause memory crashes. For this lesson we'll only pass on the top five relevant results based on their RRF score.

**3. Display the Relevant Results:**

The filtered DataFrame `relevant_results_df` is printed to the console for reference. This allows you to see which RAG results have been identified as relevant by the Mistral 7B model.

<pre>
2.8 - Filter relevant results

relevant_results_df = final_results_df_with_mistral[final_results_df_with_mistral['Mistral Output'].str.contains("Relevant", na=False)]

# Limit the number of matches to no more than 5 results; reduces chance of memory crash.
relevant_results_df = relevant_results_df.head(5)

# Display the relevant results for reference
print(relevant_results_df['Document ID'])
</pre>

## Generating LLM Response without RAG

Having determined which RAG results are relevant, we are now ready to feed those results to Mistral to formulate a response. However, it is instructive to see the difference between the LLM's raw response versus a response informed by RAG. We'll first prompt Mistral to evaluate Lincoln's views of Japan, without any of the RAG search results.

The code below describes how to implement this:

**1. Generate Initial Answer:**

The function `generate_initial_answer` is defined to create an initial prompt for the Mistral model. The prompt asks the model to offer a detailed response to the given query without using any RAG search results. The model's response is then processed to extract the answer text.

**2. Display the Initial Answer:**

The generated initial answer is printed to the console for reference. This allows you to see Mistral's response to the query before incorporating the relevant RAG results.

<pre>
2.9 - Querying Mistral without RAG

def generate_initial_answer(query, pipe):
    initial_prompt = f"&lt;s&gt;[INST] Offer a detailed response answering this query.\n\nQuery: {query}\n\nAnswer: [/INST]"
    response = pipe(initial_prompt, max_new_tokens=1000, temperature=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.15, num_return_sequences=1)
    initial_answer = response[0]['generated_text'].split('[/INST]')[-1].strip()
    return initial_answer

# Generate the initial answer
initial_answer = generate_initial_answer(query, mistral_pipe)
print("Mistral Response:", initial_answer)
</pre>

> 2.10 - Mistral's Response:
>
>Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, had limited direct interaction with Japan during his tenure from 1861 to 1865. However, there are some historical records and context that provide insights into how he viewed Japan and its people.
>
>During Lincoln's time, Japan was in a period of isolationism known as "Sakoku," which began in the late 17th century and lasted until the mid-19th century. This policy restricted foreign contact and trade with other nations, including the United States. As a result, there were few opportunities for diplomatic or commercial exchanges between the two countries during Lincoln's presidency.
>
>However, there is evidence that Lincoln was interested in Japan and its culture. In 1860, while serving as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Lincoln wrote a letter to a friend, William S. Rosecrans, who was then stationed in Yokohama, Japan, as part of the American legation. In the letter, Lincoln expressed his admiration for Japanese art and culture, particularly their woodblock prints. He also asked Rosecrans to bring back any samples he could find.
>
>Lincoln's interest in Japan extended beyond aesthetics. He recognized the strategic importance of Asia in global politics and economics. During the Civil War, the United States sought to expand its influence in the Pacific region, competing with European powers such as Britain and Russia. In 1863, Lincoln signed the Treaty of Washington, which established an open door policy towards Japan, allowing American merchants to trade freely in Japanese ports.
>
>Despite these efforts, Japan remained closed to the outside world, and it wasn't until after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 that the country began to open up to international trade and diplomacy. By then, Lincoln was no longer president, but his earlier interest in Japan and its people foreshadowed the growing relationship between the two nations in the following decades.

In evaluating this response, Mistral demonstrates a degree of accurate knowledge concerning Japan during Lincoln's presidency. However, the response also contains significant historical errors - the Rosecrans anecdote is completely invented, and no Treaty of Washington was signed in 1863 opening Japan to trade. Of course, the response also does not contain factual details drawn from Lincoln's speeches that we've discovered through RAG.

## Generating LLM Response with RAG: Setting Prompt Template

Let's now observe how Mistral responds with RAG search results and a prompt designed for RAG tasks. As with the relevance determination task, we will set a prompt template feeding Mistral each relevant response with selected metadata. We'll also download another prompt using two examples demonstrating how we wish the RAG task to be completed.

**Special Note:** Memory constraints for few-shot prompting

Due to the considerable length of the RAG prompts, only two examples are used in the prompt below. While Mistral's context length can fit additional examples, repeated testing found that the GPU memory for the free Google Colab tier was insufficient to process these examples. For the benefit of this lesson, we'll use the two examples to establish a baseline measure.

The code below describes how this is accomplished:

**1. Function Definition: construct_final_prompt:**

This function constructs the final prompt for Mistral by combining the user query, initial answer, and relevant results.

**2. Iterate Over Relevant Results:**

The function iterates over each row in the `relevant_results_df` DataFrame, extracting information such as `text_id`, `source`, `key_quote`, and `mistral_output`.

**3. Extract Information from Mistral Output:**

Regular expressions are used to extract "Quote Extraction" and "Contextual Relevance" from the `mistral_output`. If these fields are not found, default values "N/A" are used.

**4. Append Extracted Information to Prompt Lines:**

The extracted information is appended to the `prompt_lines` list.

**5. Join Prompt Lines:**

The `prompt_lines` list is joined into a single string with double newline separators to form the final prompt.

**6. Construct and Print the Final Prompt:**

The `construct_final_prompt` function is called with the user query, initial answer, and relevant results DataFrame to create the final prompt. The constructed prompt is then printed for review.

Text ID: 48

Source: First Annual Message. December 3, 1861.

Key Quote: By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce, in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to re-capture any prizes which pirates might make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts, now established by law in eastern countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a Charge d'affaires near each of those new states. It does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable commercial treaties with them. The operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment have been conducted with signal success.

Quote Extraction: If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it.

Contextual Relevance: In his First Annual Message, Lincoln acknowledges the potential commercial benefits of establishing diplomatic relations with Haiti and Liberia. He suggests that recognizing their independence could lead to advantageous commercial treaties, thereby expanding American economic influence. This perspective highlights Lincoln's pragmatic approach to foreign affairs and his commitment to promoting US commercial interests.

Key Quote: The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia; and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European states, remain undisturbed.

Quote Extraction: A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia; and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of Hayti.

Contextual Relevance: In his Second Annual Message, Lincoln mentions the successful negotiation of a commercial treaty with Liberia, highlighting the diplomatic efforts made to strengthen economic ties with foreign nations, including former slave colonies like Liberia. This demonstrates Lincoln's commitment to expanding international trade opportunities for the United States while promoting goodwill towards countries with significant historical connections to the American experience of slavery.

Source: Fourth Annual Message. December 6, 1864.

Key Quote: During the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of those republics, and, on the other hand, their sympathies with the United States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness. The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian in 1821 has been paid in full by the government of Chile. Civil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without prospect of an early close. Official correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that Republic. It may be expected to derive new vigor from American influence, improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the United States. I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat at moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by instalments. Such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native African races; and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands.

Quote Extraction: I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat at moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by installments.

Contextual Relevance: In his Fourth Annual Message, Lincoln mentions the importance of supporting Liberia, a free black republic in Africa, and requests permission to send a gunboat to aid in its defense against native African tribes and help suppress the transatlantic slave trade. This demonstrates Lincoln's commitment to promoting freedom and self-governance for formerly enslaved peoples, both domestically and internationally.

Quote Driven Response with Citations:

Abraham Lincoln’s speeches reflect a consistent support for Liberia, highlighting its importance in his foreign policy. In his First Annual Message on December 3, 1861, Lincoln discusses the potential advantages of recognizing the independence of Liberia and Haiti. He states, “If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it” (First Annual Message, December 3, 1861). This acknowledgment underscores Lincoln’s pragmatic approach to foreign affairs, emphasizing the commercial benefits that could arise from such recognition.

Lincoln's commitment to establishing stronger ties with Liberia is further evident in his Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862. He notes the progress made in negotiating a commercial and consular treaty with Liberia, reflecting his administration’s efforts to formalize and enhance economic relations: “A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia; and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of Hayti” (Second Annual Message, December 1, 1862). This demonstrates Lincoln's strategic intent to foster international trade opportunities and diplomatic goodwill.

In his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln speaks of the positive developments in Liberia, acknowledging the country's social and political progress and expressing a desire to support its continued growth. He requests Congress’s authority to provide a gunboat to Liberia, highlighting the practical assistance needed for the nation’s defense and its role in suppressing the slave trade: “I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat at moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by installments” (Fourth Annual Message, December 6, 1864). This appeal illustrates Lincoln’s broader vision of supporting freedom and self-governance for formerly enslaved peoples, both domestically and internationally.

Lincoln's speeches demonstrate a clear and consistent policy of recognizing and supporting Liberia's independence, fostering economic ties, and providing practical assistance to ensure its stability and progress. These efforts are indicative of his broader commitment to promoting liberty and justice beyond the borders of the United States.

Key Quote: "Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:

Having been convened on an extraordinary occasion, as authorized by the Constitution, your attention is not called to any ordinary subject of legislation. At the beginning of the present Presidential term, four months ago, the functions of the Federal Government were found to be generally suspended within the several States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, excepting only those of the Post Office Department. Within these States, all the Forts, Arsenals, Dock-yards, Customhouses, and the like, including the movable and stationary property in, and about them, had been seized, and were held in open hostility to this Government, excepting only Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson, on, and near the Florida coast, and Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbor, South Carolina. The Forts thus seized had been put in improved condition; new ones had been built; and armed forces had been organized, and were organizing, all avowedly with the same hostile purpose. The Forts remaining in the possession of the Federal government, in, and near, these States, were either besieged or menaced by warlike preparations; and especially Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and outnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one.

Extracted Quote: Within these States, all the Forts, Arsenals, Dock-yards, Customhouses, and the like, including the movable and stationary property in, and about them, had been seized, and were held in open hostility to this Government....and especially Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and outnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one."

Contextual Relevance: In this excerpt from Lincoln's message to Congress on July 4, 1861, he justifies the need to reinforce and resupply Fort Sumter based on the military situation at the time. He explains how the Confederate states had seized federal fortifications and put them in a state of hostility towards the US government, while Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson remained under federal control. Lincoln describes Fort Sumter as being nearly surrounded by Confederate batteries, with superior firepower, making it essential for the Union to maintain control of the fort to prevent further loss of territory. His appeal to Congress for resources to reinforce Fort Sumter was a crucial step in the escalation of the Civil War.

Key Quote: This order could not go by land, but must take the longer, and slower route by sea. The first return news from the order was received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter. The news itself was, that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some quasi armistice of the late administration, (and of the existence of which, the present administration, up to the time the order was despatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors, to fix attention) had refused to land the troops. To now re-inforce Fort Pickens, before a crisis would be
reached at Fort Sumter was impossible---rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named Fort. In precaution against such a conjuncture, the government had, a few days before, commenced preparing an expedition, as well adapted as might be, to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to be ultimately used, or not, according to circumstances. The strongest anticipated case, for using it, was now presented; and it was resolved to send it forward. As had been intended, in this contingency, it was also resolved to notify the Governor of South Carolina, that he might except an attempt would be made to provision the Fort; and that, if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack upon the Fort.

Contextual Relevance: In this excerpt from Lincoln's July 4th Message to Congress, he explains the challenges faced in reinforcing and resupplying Fort Sumter, which was under siege by Confederate forces. The president describes how the troops had been transferred to the Sabine, but the commander of that vessel refused to land them due to unclear political circumstances. With Fort Sumter running low on provisions, the government prepared an expedition to relieve it, and this became the strongest anticipated case for using the expedition. Lincoln also notified the governor of South Carolina that an attempt would be made to provision the fort, and warned that no attempt would be made to throw in men, arms, or ammunition without further notice, or in case of an attack upon the fort. This passage highlights the urgency and complexity of maintaining federal control over key military installations during the early stages of the Civil War.

Source:  First Annual Message. December 3, 1861.

Key Quote: The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration, and the message to Congress at the late special session, were both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract, to or from, the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents. The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably, expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter; and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then, is much better defined and more distinct now; and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason and Dixon's line; and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on the point.

Extracted Quote: The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably, expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter; and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable.

Contextual Relevance: In his First Annual Message, Lincoln justifies the challenges of reinforcing and resupplying Fort Sumter as crucial steps towards preserving the Union. He acknowledges the initial uncertainty regarding support for the Confederacy from the North, but emphasizes that the progress of events has clarified the situation and put the Union on the right path towards restoration.

Quote Driven Response with Citations:

In his speeches, Abraham Lincoln justified the challenges of reinforcing and resupplying Fort Sumter by emphasizing the constitutional duty to maintain federal authority and protect federal property. He framed these efforts within the broader context of the secession crisis and the need to uphold federal sovereignty.

In his message to Congress on July 4, 1861, Lincoln detailed the precarious situation at Fort Sumter, highlighting that federal fortifications had been seized by Confederate forces and that Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by superior enemy batteries. He described the necessity of maintaining control over federal installations like Fort Sumter, which were besieged or menaced by warlike preparations: "Within these States, all the Forts, Arsenals, Dock-yards, Customhouses, and the like, including the movable and stationary property in, and about them, had been seized, and were held in open hostility to this Government....and especially Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and outnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one" (July 4th Message to Congress, July 4, 1861).

Lincoln also addressed the logistical difficulties of reinforcing Fort Sumter. He explained that reinforcements had to take a longer, slower sea route, and efforts to provision the fort were further complicated by political and military obstacles: "This order could not go by land, but must take the longer, and slower route by sea. The first return news from the order was received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter. To reinforce Fort Pickens before a crisis would be reached at Fort Sumter was impossible--rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named Fort" (July 4th Message to Congress, July 4, 1861).

In his First Annual Message on December 3, 1861, Lincoln reiterated the significance of the Fort Sumter crisis in the broader context of the Civil War, describing the attack on the fort as a turning point that extinguished hopes for a peaceful resolution: "The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably, expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter; and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable" (First Annual Message, December 3, 1861).

Lincoln's justifications for the challenges of reinforcing and resupplying Fort Sumter were thus deeply rooted in his commitment to upholding federal authority and sovereignty, as well as navigating the complex legal and political landscape of the secession crisis.

Good. Let's try another.

Key Quote: A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia; and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European states, remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and <mark><mark>Japan</mark></mark>. During the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent states of our own continent, but, more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed, are believed to be entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress, are so intimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile. The commission under the convention with the republic of New Granada closed its session, without having audited and passed upon, all the claims which were submitted to it.

## Interpreting Results

In comparing Mistral's raw response versus its RAG-informed response, we can observe some comparative strengths and weaknesses.

The RAG response is grounded by information derived from the Lincoln corpus, providing a concise summary of what Lincoln communicated about the U.S.-Japan relationship through his annual messages to Congress. Further, Mistral provides citations for its sources along with detailed search results from RAG, allowing end-users to verify the accuracy of the model's responses. This provides a significant mitigation of the "hallucinations" found in Mistral's original response.

To be sure, there is room for improvement. While Mistral's raw response contains significant defects, it does seek to contextualize the query within the broader historical context of the period. That context is important to truly understand the significance of these search results. Events such as the Perry Expedition, U.S. military actions against Japan in the [Shimonoseki campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimonoseki_campaign), and the significance of the Meiji Restoration are important details needed for a truly informed response. (Likewise, the citation style employed here is also often inconsistently formatted from generation to generation, a product of the limited number of RAG examples usable in this memory environment.)

Thankfully, given RAG's modular nature such improvements can be readily implemented. One approach is to pass on the query and RAG summary to a more advanced model enabled with web search. Let's conclude with GPT-4's new response to our original query: "How did Lincoln regard Japan?"

>**GPT-4 with RAG:** Abraham Lincoln's perspectives on Japan were influenced by the broader diplomatic landscape and international dynamics of his presidency, a period marked by significant global shifts and the American Civil War. Lincoln's administration encountered Japan at a critical juncture when the country was grappling with internal upheavals and external pressures to open up to the world, a process that had been initiated by Commodore Perry's expeditions in the 1850s.</p>
>
>In his Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862, Lincoln highlighted the importance of maintaining favorable diplomatic and economic relations with several non-Western nations, including Japan. He stated, "Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan." This brief mention of Japan alongside other nations indicates an early awareness of Japan's strategic importance as part of a network of relationships supporting American commercial and geopolitical interests.
>
>However, the challenges in dealing with Japan became more apparent by the time of Lincoln's Third Annual Message on December 8, 1863. He recognized the complications arising from Japan's internal politics, particularly the resistance from the Japanese aristocracy to the shogun's progressive policies. Lincoln acknowledged the serious jeopardy that US-Japanese relations had faced due to this internal opposition and specifically addressed the incident involving the destruction of the US legation residence at Yedo (Tokyo). He appealed to Congress for attention to the US minister's claims for damages, illustrating the precarious nature of diplomatic relations and the volatility of Japan's political environment during the Bakumatsu era, characterized by the declining power of the Tokugawa shogunate and increasing pressure from both domestic factions and foreign powers.
>
>In his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln provided a more comprehensive analysis of Japan's governance and the ongoing diplomatic challenges. He described Japan's government as "inconsistent and capricious" in fulfilling treaty obligations but remained optimistic about the progress achieved through international cooperation and economic engagement. Lincoln noted, "good progress has been effected by the western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed, or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce." This optimism underscored Lincoln's belief in the potential for diplomacy and economic incentives to foster positive relations, even with a nation undergoing significant internal strife. He further emphasized that these proceedings had "increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan towards the United States," reflecting his commitment to maintaining and strengthening US-Japanese relations despite the inherent challenges.
>
>In the broader historical context, Lincoln's approach to Japan can be seen as part of a wider American strategy of engagement with Asia during a time of significant global change. His administration's efforts to navigate the complexities of Japanese politics and secure economic opportunities reflect the United States' burgeoning interest in expanding its influence in the Pacific, an interest that would continue to grow in the latter half of the 19th century. Lincoln's nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities in US-Japanese relations highlights his pragmatic approach to foreign policy, one that balanced idealistic aspirations of international cooperation with the realistic acknowledgment of political and cultural differences.

## Evaluating RAG

While the RAG pipeline produced a satisfactory result for our query, more robust testing is needed to determine the overall effectiveness of the application. To facilitate this, a dozen questions concerning Lincoln and his times were assembled into a standard set of queries, or a benchmark. Each question was then run through the RAG pipeline, resulting in 123 distinct results. From these results, each Mistral output for the relevance determination task was scored by more advanced LLMs for accuracy. [(The data for this evaluation is available in this article's Github Repo)](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/programming_historian/tree/main/evaluation/relevance_task). This scoring enables evaluation of the RAG pipeline to determine its strengths and areas for improvement.

Below are the findings from the benchmark results:

**Evaluation Findings:**

* **Overall Effectiveness**: The retriever supplied relevant results to user queries 100% of the time (Figure 3), with 60% of all returned matches deemed relevant to queries (Figure 4). This indicates that while the application reliably returns relevant information, there is room for improvement concerning precision.
* **Evaluating Search Approaches:** Of the three search methods, semantic search and ColBERT achieved the strongest results, with semantic search catching the greatest number of relevant matches (Figures 5 & 6) while ColBERT demonstrated greatest precision in finding relevant results. (Figure 7) BM25 produced relevant matches at a 37% accuracy rate, contributing some 20% of all relevant results. We'll discuss techniques for improving this rate in a later section.
* **Reranker Performance:** One method to determine the effectiveness of the reranker model is to see what percentage of relevant results were ranked in the top five matches. Over 50% of all results fell below this rank, indicating the reranker may lack desired precision for this task. (Figure 8)
* **Relevance Determination Task:** To establish an evaluation baseline for this benchmark, GPT-4 was used to score each Mistral-7B output for the relevance determination task (see Methodology section below). Based on GPT-4's outputs, it agrees with Mistral's performance over 95% of the time, suggesting that Mistral is highly effective at this task when using the given prompt approach. (Figure 9) This assessment is largely supported by other LLMs scoring this data. Performance in other elements of the task are more mixed. (Figure 10). Achieving improved performance could be achieved by adding a greater number of prompt tasks or utilizing model finetuning.

In the Advanced RAG section below, we examine ways to enhance the performance of RAG search systems based on these findings.

## Methodology: Scoring RAG Results with LLMs

To provide a baseline for RAG pipeline's performance, the results of the relevance determination task were scored by GPT-4 for accuracy. Here is the structure of the Mistral outputs for this task:

<pre>
Query: How did Lincoln justify the Civil War in his speeches?

Document ID: Text #: 79

Key Quote: With high hope for the future....

Source: Second Inaugural Address. March 4, 1865.

Total Relevance Score: 75%

1. Document Relevance: Relevant
2. Quote Extraction: "Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive....
3. Contextual Relevance: In his Second Inaugural Address, Lincoln justified the Civil War as an unavoidable conflict....
</pre>

<pre>

Source: Fourth Annual Message. December 6, 1864.

Total Relevance Score: 82%

1. Document Relevance: Irrelevant
2. Quote Extraction: NaN
3. Contextual Relevance: NaN
</pre>

To evaluate the Mistral's ability to determine relevance, extract quotes, and provide contextual relevance we tested its responses against GPT-4 using [this notebook.](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/programming_historian/blob/main/evaluation/relevance_task/Evaluation_Notebook.ipynb) When prompted, GPT-4 scores each section of Mistral's output in each category: "1" for agreement with Mistral or "0" for disagreement, in the following manner:

Example Score for GPT-4's total agreement with Mistral:

<pre>
{
  "Relevance": 1,
  "Quote Extraction": 1,
  "Contextual Relevance": 1
}
</pre>

Example Score for GPT-4's total disagreement with Mistral:

<pre>
{
  "Relevance": 0,
  "Quote Extraction": 0,
  "Contextual Relevance": 0
}
</pre>

Example Score for GPT-4's partial agreement with Mistral:

<pre>
{
  "Relevance": 1,
  "Quote Extraction": 0,
  "Contextual Relevance": 0
}
</pre>

Overall, GPT-4 reported strikingly strong agreement (95%) with Mistral's assessment of relevance, and lesser agreement for outputs for the other two categories. (Section 3.9). GPT-4's performance on this prompt was further tested against Anthropic's [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) and Cohere's [Command-R+](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r-plus) models. Claude found similarly strong agreement with Mistral's relevance determinations; Command-R+ also found agreement, albeit to a lesser extent. While LLMs are imperfect judges for this task and may introduce errors, overall advanced LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on tasks for determining textual relevance. While imperfect, their relative cost and speed have resulted in LLMs becoming increasingly popular for automating evaluation tasks such as this.

Below are the results for agreement between the models of these three tasks:

There are other evaluation metrics that can be employed to examine the effectiveness of a RAG pipeline. Two methods commonly used for scoring RAG summaries are are [BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and [ROUGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)) (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). Methods like [BERTScore](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score) and specialized RAG evaluation approaches like [ARES](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ARES) and [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) offer additional insights into the quality of RAG summaries. Frameworks like [Langchain](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/old/cookbook/testing-examples) now offer a host of automated evaluation pipelines for a variety of performance areas. And of course, scholars should consider their own training and expertise in devising judgments of RAG's place in the historian's toolkit.

## Evaluating RAG as Historians

While a host of quantitative metrics provide insights into a RAG pipeline's performance, they offer limited insight into this approach's potential for historical research. Indeed, historians require more than simple summaries or automated extracts of primary source collections. Our discipline demands critical assessment of sources, consideration of multiple perspectives, and the ability to contextualize the past.

RAG's true value lies in its potential to aid historians in these critical tasks. By programmatically analyzing large datasets of historical documents in customizable ways, RAG can do more than just uncover sources that might have been missed with other methods. RAG can help us "cross-reference" vast amounts of information, develop new research questions and approaches, and leverage generative AI's potential in ways that promote verifiability and transparency.

Many historians may be skeptical of generative AI's potential to contribute to these ends. AI "hallucinations" distort the historical record, and LLM "analysis" of the past can go wildly wrong. Even in areas where they are well-informed, LLMs do not always demonstrate historical nuance. Take, for example, LLM interpretations of texts addressing Lincoln's evolving views on race and African American citizenship. These are complex and sensitive issues that demand a deep understanding of historical context and the ability to grapple with shifts in Lincoln's language and thought over time. RAG, when carefully implemented, can assist historians in navigating these complexities by providing access to primary sources and offering summaries that are informed by existing scholarship and feature historiographical nuance. But if poorly implemented, such frameworks can perpetuate misinformation and misunderstanding, especially if utilized without an understanding of AI's limitations.

Continuing advances in generative AI make it difficult to predict the pace of improvement of these technologies. Yet however far these models advance, it is crucial to remember that RAG is not a replacement for the historian or for careful historical assessment. The summaries produced by RAG can be thought of as a first draft from an automated research tool, aiding the historian in identifying and contextualizing evidence. But in the end, it is the historian who is responsible for evaluating sources, verifying factual accuracy, and interpreting historical events within a broader context.

The potential of these tools for historical research is certainly an area of active research; indeed, [historians](https://nicolay-honestabes-info.streamlit.app/), [archivists](https://chat.eluxemburgensia.lu/), and [librarians](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/02/12/warc-gpt-an-open-source-tool-for-exploring-web-archives-with-ai/) are already demonstrating how RAG can be leveraged to promote scholarship and extend access to our shared past. To see a state-of-the-art RAG pipeline at work, I highly encourage readers to try out [STORM](https://storm-project.stanford.edu/), which uses RAG techniques to generate Wikipedia-style articles based on user queries.

And as the technologies underpinning this approach evolve, we can expect to see continued advances in model performance. The emergence of multimodal RAG, for instance, allows search over multiple domains - text, image, sound, and video. This will allow researchers to integrate a whole new range of historical data in innovative ways. In embracing the possibilities of AI while remaining mindful of its limitations, historians of the future will increasingly find creative ways to transform raw data into the basis for meaningful dialogue about the past.

## Advanced RAG: For Further Exploration

The evaluation of our RAG pipeline revealed several key areas that could benefit from further improvement. While our approach successfully retrieved relevant information, there is room for enhancing precision, particularly in the ranking of results and the overall performance of the keyword search. Furthermore, while Mistral-7B proved adept at determining the relevance of retrieved documents, it sometimes struggled to fully integrate those findings into comprehensive and nuanced summaries. Fortunately, advanced RAG techniques can address these limitations, and offer new approaches to enrich existing RAG pipelines.

**Model Finetuning:**

One way to enhance RAG's overall performance is through model fine-tuning. This process involves training RAG retrievers and LLMs on a specific dataset or adapting it to a particular task. In our case, fine-tuning Mistral-7B on a curated collection of RAG tasks tailored to Lincoln's speeches could improve the LLMs ability to understand Lincoln's language, historical context, and nuanced positions on complex issues like race and citizenship, thus grounding Mistral's outputs for historical analysis.

For example, the [*Nicolay* project](https://nicolay-honestabes-info.streamlit.app/RAG_with_Hay_&_Nicolay) (from which this article is based) has incorporated two fine-tuned LLMs as core components for both search and crafting RAG summaries, with noticeable improvements in performance. One task on which the models were finetuned is query rewriting, which greatly enhanced the effectiveness of keyword search, a weak area in our RAG pipeline. (This approach is described in greater detail below.) Improved reranking would also benefit our pipeline - as it happens, Cohere now offers a finetuning API endpoint for its Rerank model.

Please note that model finetuning can be an intensive process. To effectively finetune you need sets of curated question/answer pairs to train the model, much like the few-shot prompting method discussed earlier. For example, in the *Nicolay* project the author used [finetuning sets](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/nicolay/tree/main/data/finetuning_datasets) of fifty question/answer pairs for each finetuned model (one hundred examples in total) to train customized versions of OpenAI's GPT-3.5. Open-source models may require many more examples to achieve the same performance. (Thankfully, LLMs have proven useful in creating these pairs, a process called generating synthetic data). Finetuning can also require substantial computing power if done locally. Using external finetuning services via APIs is a recommended alternative in terms of convenience, time, and expense.

**Query Rewriting**

Another promising technique is query rewriting. By automatically reformulating the user's query in different ways, RAG can enhance the effectiveness of keyword search and increase the chances of retrieving relevant information.

For example, if a user asks "How did Lincoln defend the Emancipation Proclamation?", a specialized model could rewrite the query using specific key terms likely to result in relevant results: "Emancipation" and "Proclamation", but also "forever free" or other specific excerpts from the text. This could be done by a finetuned or prompted LLM. (*Nicolay* uses a fine-tuned model) This method can help capture a wider range of relevant documents, potentially improving both the recall and precision of methods like keyword search.

**Self-Reflective RAG**

An interesting approach to addressing errors in RAG summaries is Self-RAG and Corrective RAG (CRAG). These approaches use LLMs to iteratively parse and review RAG summaries to detect flaws in reasoning and confirm knowledge claims.

**Prompt Finetuning**

This lesson explored prompt design approaches like [few-shot prompting](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.promptingguide.ai%2Ftechniques%2Ffewshot), or using crafted instructions and examples to guide LLM behavior. A promising new approach is prompt tuning. Unlike few-shot prompting, prompt tuning automates and optimizes the prompt design process through machine learning techniques. The [DSPY framework](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy?tab=readme-ov-file) offers powerful tools for fine-tuning prompts tailored to specific RAG tasks.

**Multimodal RAG:**

The emergence of multimodal RAG, or search over multiple domains (text, image, sound, video) holds significant promise, allowing researchers to integrate visual and textual data in new and innovative ways. By embracing the possibilities of RAG while remaining mindful of its limitations, historians can unlock exciting new avenues for exploring the past.

**Agentic RAG:**

Agentic RAG is a framework by which instead of an end-to-end pipeline, LLMs autonomously orchestrate a plan of action and utilize tools to complete retrieval and analytical tasks. Such tools could include web search, optical character recognition, connecting to external databases, run code in programming environments, or numerous other approaches. For those interested in a vivid example of this approach, I highly encourage readers to explore [STORM](https://storm-project.stanford.edu/), an impressive agentic RAG that generates custom Wikipedia-style articles on subjects based on user prompts.
