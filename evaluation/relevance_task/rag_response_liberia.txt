Abraham Lincoln's speeches reveal a consistent interest in Liberia, a free black republic in Africa, which is reflected in various aspects of his foreign policy. In his First Annual Message on December 3, 1861, Lincoln acknowledged the potential commercial benefits of establishing diplomatic relations with Liberia and Haiti, stating, "If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it" (Text #: 48). This perspective highlights Lincoln's pragmatic approach to foreign affairs and his commitment to promoting US commercial interests.

Moreover, in his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln requested permission to send a gunboat to aid Liberia in its defense against native African tribes and help suppress the transatlantic slave trade. He expressed his belief that "such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native African races; and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands" (Text #: 72). This demonstrates Lincoln's commitment to promoting freedom and self-governance for formerly enslaved peoples, both domestically and internationally.

Additionally, in his Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862, Lincoln mentioned the successful negotiation of a commercial treaty with Liberia, which showed his administration's efforts to formalize and enhance economic relations with foreign nations, including former slave colonies like Liberia. This diplomatic initiative demonstrated Lincoln's strategic intent to foster international trade opportunities and diplomatic goodwill.

Overall, Lincoln's speeches demonstrate a clear and consistent policy of recognizing and supporting Liberia's independence, fostering economic ties, and providing practical assistance to ensure its stability and progress. These efforts are indicative of his broader vision of supporting freedom and justice beyond the borders of the United States.
