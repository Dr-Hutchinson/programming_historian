Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, regarded John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry as a significant and provocative event that heightened tensions between the Northern states advocating for abolition and slavery-supporting Southern states in the lead-up to the American Civil War. The incident occurred on October 17, 1859, when John Brown, an influential figure in the abolitionist movement, led a small group of men with the intention of seizing the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia), and using it to establish a base for a larger slave insurrection.

Lincoln, who was then a member of the House of Representatives from Illinois, did not publicly comment on the raid until several months later, after he had become president. In his first inaugural address on March 4, 1861, Lincoln denounced John Brown as "a fanatical leader," but also acknowledged that the man and his cause were symptoms of deeper problems within the nation. He stated, "Let us have peace. But let us have a peace that will heal, not wound."

In private, however, Lincoln expressed more nuanced views about John Brown and his actions. In a letter to Ohio Governor William Dennison, written just days before the inauguration, Lincoln described Brown as "a mercenary agent, employed upon what might be considered a designing and malignant enterprise." Yet, he also recognized that Brown's raid had served to galvanize the antislavery forces and bring attention to their cause.

Lincoln's stance on John Brown's raid can be seen as a reflection of his broader political strategy during this period. He sought to maintain the Union while also addressing the issue of slavery, which he believed could only be resolved through peaceful means. By condemning John Brown's violent tactics while acknowledging the underlying issues that drove him, Lincoln aimed to strike a balance between preserving the Union and advancing the cause of emancipation.
