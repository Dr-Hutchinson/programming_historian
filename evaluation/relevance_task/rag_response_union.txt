In his speeches, Abraham Lincoln rallied public support for the Union war effort by emphasizing the importance of preserving the Union and the shared commitment of Americans to upholding its principles. In his Second Inaugural Address on March 4, 1865, Lincoln reminded the American people of the dire consequences of allowing the Union to disintegrate, stating, "Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish" (Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865).

Moreover, in the Emancipation Proclamation issued on January 1, 1863, Lincoln used his speech to issue a decree freeing all slaves in areas still in rebellion against the United States. This was a significant move to rally public support for the Union war effort by appealing to the moral principles of human freedom and equality (Emancipation Proclamation, January 1, 1863).

Additionally, in his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln emphasized the unity and determination of the American people to preserve the Union, as evidenced by the results of recent elections. He highlighted the fact that no candidates had dared to campaign on a platform of abandoning the Union, indicating the widespread commitment to maintaining the Union despite political differences (Fourth Annual Message, December 6, 1864).

In a letter to James Conkling on August 26, 1863, Lincoln acknowledged that some individuals might not be motivated by the goal of freeing enslaved people but encouraged them to focus solely on the Union cause. He believed that the enlistment of Black soldiers and the weakening of the Confederacy through the emancipation of their slaves would contribute to the overall success of the Union war effort (Public Letter to James Conkling, August 26, 1863).

Throughout his speeches, Lincoln consistently emphasized the importance of preserving the Union and the shared commitment of Americans to upholding its principles. By focusing on the Union cause as the primary objective, Lincoln was able to rally public support and maintain morale during the tumultuous period of the American Civil War.
