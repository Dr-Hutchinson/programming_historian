Abraham Lincoln's vision for African Americans after the Civil War was centered around their role in society as free laborers and contributors to the economy. In his speeches and messages, he emphasized the importance of their military service during the war and the potential benefits of their labor in various industries.

In his Third Annual Message on December 8, 1863, Lincoln discussed the implementation of emancipation and the role of African Americans in the military. He noted that over 100,000 former slaves had joined the United States military service, with half actively bearing arms in the ranks. Lincoln saw this as an opportunity to reduce the need for white soldiers and weaken the Confederacy's resistance to the Union. He also acknowledged the potential for improved international perception of the United States' treatment of former slaves.

In the same message, Lincoln shared his belief in a gradual process of resettlement and economic self-sufficiency for freedmen. He envisioned that former slave owners would continue to employ them as wage laborers while they transitioned to new communities and livelihoods. This approach aimed to minimize social tensions and economic challenges arising from the end of slavery.

In a letter to James Conkling on August 26, 1863, Lincoln expressed his belief that the primary objective of the Civil War was to preserve the Union. He acknowledged that some may argue against the emancipation of enslaved Africans but emphasized that their contribution to the war effort weakened the Confederacy and reduced the need for white soldiers. Although Lincoln didn't outline a definitive post-Civil War vision for African Americans in this text, he hinted at the possibility of a gradual transition towards a society without slavery once the Union was secure.

These excerpts demonstrate Lincoln's vision for African Americans after the Civil War, focusing on their role as free laborers and their potential contributions to society and the economy.
