How did Lincoln explain the importance of the naval blockade against the Confederacy?,Text #: 42,"At a stroke, it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only what proceeds from the external blockade. It would do for the disunionists that which, of all things, they most desire---feed them well, and give them disunion without a struggle of their own. It recognizes no fidelity to the Constitution, no obligation to maintain the Union; and while very many who have favored it are, doubtless, loyal citizens, it is, nevertheless, treason in effect. Recurring to the action of the government, it may be stated that, at first, a call was made for seventy-five thousand militia; and rapidly following this, a proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings in the nature of Blockade. So far all was believed to be strictly legal. At this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering. Other calls were made for volunteers, to serve three years, unless sooner discharged; and also for large additions to the regular Army and Navy.","Source:  July 4th Message to Congress.

While the response was generally gratifying, the so-called ""slave states"" and border states had mixed reactions. Virginia's actions were particularly noteworthy, as they allowed the insurrection to take root within their borders, seizing the United States Armory and Navy-yard, and aligning themselves with the Confederate States. The concept of ""armed neutrality"" in border states is criticized as effectively supporting disunion. Despite potential legal questions surrounding the government's actions, such as issuing calls for volunteers and closing ports, Lincoln trusts that Congress will ratify these measures as they are believed to be within their constitutional competency."," call for troops, slave states, border states, Virginia, insurrection, armed neutrality, disunion, constitutional competency, Congress.",Qdrant,,,0.4690184249665891,1.0,,,0.11125484,2.0,88%,"Relevant

The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency, as the navy has expanded; yet on so long a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade.

The naval force of the United States consists at this time of five hundred and eighty-eight vessels, completed and in the course of completion, and of these seventy-five are iron-clad or armored steamers.
