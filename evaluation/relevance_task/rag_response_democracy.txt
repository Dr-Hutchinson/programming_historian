Abraham Lincoln regarded democracy as a form of government that derives its just powers from the consent of the governed and prioritizes the elevation of all people. In his speech at Peoria, Illinois (October 16, 1854), he emphasized that the relationship between masters and slaves violates the democratic principle that governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

Moreover, in his July 4th Message to Congress in 1861, Lincoln highlighted the democratic nature of the Union cause, stating that it is a struggle for maintaining a government whose leading objective is to elevate the condition of men and afford equal opportunities for all. He believed that the American people, through their elections, possess the power to correct any mistakes made by their public servants.

Lincoln's words in the Cooper Union Address (February 27, 1860) demonstrate his deep understanding of the challenges faced by democratic governments, questioning whether they are inherently too weak to maintain their territorial integrity or too strong for the liberties of their people.
