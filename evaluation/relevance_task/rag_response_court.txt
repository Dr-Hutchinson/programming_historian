During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln's relationship with the Supreme Court was characterized by significant legal battles over issues related to slavery and states' rights. In his First Inaugural Address on March 4, 1861, Lincoln acknowledged the role of the Supreme Court in interpreting the Constitution but emphasized the importance of the people's ability to change their government through democratic processes. He argued that the Supreme Court's decisions should not be considered final and irreversible, as the people remain the ultimate sovereign.

However, Lincoln faced challenges in filling vacancies on the Supreme Court due to the instability caused by the ongoing conflict. In his First Annual Message on December 3, 1861, he mentioned the three vacancies on the bench, stating, "Two of the outgoing judges resided within the States now overrun by revolt; so that if successors were appointed in the same localities, they could not now serve upon their circuits; and many of the most competent men there, probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the supreme bench" (First Annual Message, December 3, 1861).

Lincoln's speeches also reveal his perspective on the Supreme Court's role in the ongoing debate regarding slavery expansion. In his "A House Divided" speech on June 16, 1858, he discussed the Supreme Court's decision in the Dred Scott case and the implications for the power of states to regulate slavery within their borders. He questioned the rationale behind treating the relationship of states and territories to the Constitution uniformly, despite significant differences in their constitutional statuses.
