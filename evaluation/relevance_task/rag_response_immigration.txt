Abraham Lincoln regarded immigration as a vital resource for restoring the nation after the devastating impact of the Civil War. In his Third Annual Message on December 8, 1863, he emphasized the need for laborers in various industries due to the increasing demand caused by the ongoing conflict. He submitted the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration to address the labor shortage and contribute to the economic growth of the United States (Text #: 66).

In his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln viewed immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams to repair the ravages of internal war and restore national strength and health (Text #: 73). He recognized the importance of securing the inflow of immigrants and ensuring their protection once they arrived in the US.

Lincoln also supported colonization as a solution for the future of freed people, acknowledging concerns regarding the potential impact of their presence on white labor markets. However, he emphasized that the decision to colonize was voluntary for both the freed people and American voters (Text #: 63). He believed that if gradual emancipation and deportation were adopted, freed people would not need to migrate north due to better economic opportunities and living conditions (Text #: 64). Ultimately, Lincoln believed that it was up to northern states to decide whether or not to accept these immigrants.

These perspectives demonstrate Lincoln's recognition of the role immigration played in strengthening the nation during times of hardship and his approach to addressing social issues arising from the end of slavery while balancing the needs and concerns of various groups within society.
