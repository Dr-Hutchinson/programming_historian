How did Lincoln regard Japan?,Text #: 47,"""Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:

In the midst of unprecedented political troubles, we have cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good health, and most abundant harvests. You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factious domestic division, is exposed to disrespect abroad; and one party, if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention. Nations, thus tempted to interfere, are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency, and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country, in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this case, discarding all moral, social, and treaty obligations, would act solely, and selfishly, for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including, especially, the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear, as yet, not to have seen their way to their object more directly, or clearly, through the destruction, than through the preservation, of the Union.","Source:  First Annual Message. December 3, 1861.","Summary: In Abraham Lincoln's Annual Message to Congress on December 3, 1861, he expresses gratitude for the nation's health and abundant harvests amid political turmoil. He addresses the concerns of foreign intervention due to the ongoing domestic conflict and suggests that foreign nations would benefit more from the preservation of the Union rather than its destruction. Lincoln emphasizes the importance of domestic loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence for the country's stability and suggests measures to maintain public defenses, including fortifications and depots of arms, as well as the construction of a railroad connecting loyal regions in East Tennessee and western North Carolina to Kentucky. He also mentions treaties focused on commerce that will be submitted to the Senate for consideration."," gratitude, foreign nations, domestic conflict, loyalty, public defenses, fortifications, railroad, commerce, treaties.",Qdrant,,,0.3595334233061806,2.0,,,-7.069178,4.0,77%,"Irrelevant.

How did Lincoln regard Japan?,Text #: 48,"""I invite your attention to the correspondence between her Britannic Majesty's minister accredited to this government, and the Secretary of State, relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June last, by the United States steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right, as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention. I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor, in his annual message to Congress in December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the 3rd of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal, over the proceeds of the surplus referred to, in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that Empire. By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce, in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to re-capture any prizes which pirates might make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts, now established by law in eastern countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities.","Source:  First Annual Message.

Lincoln also proposes authorizing commanders of sailing vessels to re-capture U.S. vessels seized by pirates and allowing consular courts to adjudicate these cases.

How did Lincoln regard Japan?,Text #: 16,"""In regard to what I had said, the advantage the slave States have over the free, in the matter of representation, the Judge replied that we, in the free States, count five free negroes as five white people, while in the slave States, they count five slaves as three whites only; and that the advantage, at last, was on the side of the free States. Now, in the slave States, they count free negroes just as we do; and it so happens that besides their slaves, they have as many free negroes as we have, and thirty-three thousand over. Thus their free negroes more than balance ours; and their advantage over us, in consequence of their slaves, still remains as I stated it.","Source:  At Peoria, Illinois. October 16, 1854.","Summary: In this excerpt, Abraham Lincoln discusses the advantage slave states have over free states in representation and the connection between the compromise measures of 1850. He argues that the measures passed only because of the understanding that the others would also pass, giving them their true character as a compromise. Lincoln also refutes Stephen Douglas's claim that the Utah and New Mexico laws authorized slavery before forming constitutions, insisting that the express provision excludes any implied authority on the subject. Lastly, he addresses the Washington territorial law, asserting that there is no repeal of the ordinance of '87 or prohibition of slavery in it."," Abraham Lincoln, Stephen Douglas, slave states, free states, representation, compromise measures of 1850, Utah, New Mexico, slavery, constitutions, Washington territorial law, ordinance of '87, prohibition.",BM25,4.481493657011928,2.0,,,,,-10.193222,7.0,68%,"Irrelevant

How did Lincoln regard Japan?,Text #: 29,"I fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse. I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry: ""What was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned?"" What is the frame of government under which we live? The answer must be: ""The Constitution of the United States."" That Constitution consists of the original, framed in 1787, (and under which the present government first went into operation,) and twelve subsequently framed amendments, the first ten of which were framed in 1789.

Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I suppose the ""thirty-nine"" who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present Government.","Source:  Cooper Union Address.

He refers to a statement by Stephen Douglas and uses it as a starting point for examining the actions of the founding fathers, who framed the Constitution, on this matter. By analyzing their votes in the Congress of the Confederation and the first Congress under the Constitution, Lincoln shows that many of the founding fathers believed the Federal Government could control slavery in federal territories."," Cooper Union Speech, Abraham Lincoln, founding fathers, Constitution, Stephen Douglas, slavery, federal territories, Congress of the Confederation, local and federal authority, Ordinance of '87.",Qdrant,,,0.2474904461079821,4.0,,,-10.19224,6.0,64%,"Irrelevant
