Abraham Lincoln's views on Japan were shaped by the diplomatic challenges and opportunities that arose during his presidency. In his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln acknowledged the inconsistent and capricious nature of Japan's government and its performance of treaty obligations. Despite these challenges, he remained optimistic about the progress made through international cooperation and the positive impact of economic engagement on US-Japanese relations. He noted, "good progress has been effected by the western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed, or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan towards the United States" (Fourth Annual Message, December 6, 1864).

In his Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862, Lincoln mentioned Japan as one of the countries with which the US maintained favorable diplomatic and economic relations. He stated, "Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan" (Second Annual Message, December 1, 1862). This passage underscores the importance of Japan as a diplomatic and economic partner during this period.

However, Lincoln also recognized the challenges posed by Japan's unique political structure and the resistance of the imperial court to Westernizing policies. In his Third Annual Message on December 8, 1863, he acknowledged the serious jeopardy that US-Japanese relations had faced due to the opposition of the Japanese aristocracy to the enlightened and liberal policies of the shogun. He asked for Congress's attention to the claim of the US minister in Japan for damages sustained in the destruction of the legation residence at Yedo (Third Annual Message, December 8, 1863).

Overall, Lincoln's speeches reveal a nuanced understanding of Japan and its role in international affairs during his presidency. While acknowledging the challenges posed by Japan's unique political structure and inconsistent adherence to treaty obligations, he remained committed to finding diplomatic solutions and maintaining economic engagement to strengthen US-Japanese relations.
