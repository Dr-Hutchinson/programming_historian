How did neutral nations like England and France impact the Civil War?,Text #: 44,"The States have their status IN the Union, and they have no other legal status. If they break from this, they can only do so against law, and by revolution. The Union, and not themselves separately, procured their independence, and their liberty. By conquest, or purchase, the Union gave each of them, whatever of independence, and liberty, it has. The Union is older than any of the States; and, in fact, it created them as States. Originally, some dependent colonies made the Union; and, in turn, the Union threw off their old dependence, for them, and made them States, such as they are. Not one of them ever had a State constitution, independent of the Union.","Source:  July 4th Message to Congress. July 4, 1861.","Summary: In his July 4 Message to Congress, Abraham Lincoln discusses the importance of a successful outcome for the Union, emphasizing that the people will support the government if it acts effectively. He then addresses the distinction between ""secession"" and ""rebellion,"" and criticizes the sophism that any state can lawfully and peacefully withdraw from the Union. He argues that this idea relies on an assumption of state sovereignty, which he disputes by asserting that states have no legal status outside the Union. Lincoln emphasizes that the Union created the states and is responsible for their independence and liberty, while state sovereignty is not recognized in the Constitution."," Union, success, secession, rebellion, state sovereignty, Constitution, independence, liberty, states.",Qdrant,,,0.4028367247447912,1.0,,,-5.870571,2.0,88%,"Relevant (but weakly)

Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to Almighty God. The condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory. Mexico continues to be a theatre of civil war. While our political relations with that country have undergone no change, we have, at the same time, strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents. At the request of the states of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and the port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions, and caused a closing of the inter-oceanic transit route, have been amicably adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. We could not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great improvement.","Source:  Fourth Annual Message.

If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are, might reasonably have apprehended.
