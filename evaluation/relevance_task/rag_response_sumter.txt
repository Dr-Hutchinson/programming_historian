In his speeches, Abraham Lincoln addressed the challenges of reinforcing and resupplying Fort Sumter as essential steps towards preserving the Union and upholding federal authority. In his July 4th Message to Congress on July 4, 1861, Lincoln described the dire military situation surrounding Fort Sumter, which was under siege by Confederate forces. He explained that the government had prepared an expedition to relieve the fort, as the strongest anticipated case for using it, and notified the governor of South Carolina of the intention to provision the fort, warning that no attempt would be made to throw in men, arms, or ammunition without further notice or in case of an attack upon the fort (Text #: 41).

In his First Annual Message on December 3, 1861, Lincoln acknowledged the uncertainty regarding support for the Confederacy from the North but emphasized the progress of events and the Union's commitment to restoring the Union (Text #: 52). He also highlighted the importance of Fort Sumter in the context of the secession crisis, stating that the last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably had expired with the assault upon the fort (Text #: 40).

These speeches demonstrate Lincoln's unwavering dedication to preserving the Union and upholding federal sovereignty, even in the face of significant opposition and military challenges. By justifying the need to reinforce and resupply Fort Sumter, Lincoln took crucial steps towards escalating the conflict and ultimately paving the way for the restoration of the Union.
