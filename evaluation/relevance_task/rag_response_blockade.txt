In Abraham Lincoln's speeches, the importance of the naval blockade against the Confederacy is consistently emphasized as a crucial aspect of the Union's war effort. In his July 4th Message to Congress on July 4, 1861, Lincoln explains that the naval blockade was initiated to prevent the Confederacy from engaging in international trade and receiving military support from foreign powers. He notes that the Confederacy responded by announcing their intention to engage in privateering, leading to further escalations in military recruitment and resources dedicated to enforcing the blockade (Text #: 42).

In his Third Annual Message on December 8, 1863, Lincoln highlights the success of the naval blockade, reporting that over one thousand vessels have been captured and thirteen million dollars in prizes seized since its institution (Text #: 67). He also acknowledges the challenges of enforcing the blockade along a lengthy coastline and the potential for unintended harm to foreign nations and their subjects (Text #: 57). Lincoln emphasizes his efforts to hear and redress complaints from friendly powers in clear cases, demonstrating his commitment to preserving international peace and friendship despite the complexities of the naval blockade (Text #: 57).

Moreover, in his Third Annual Message, Lincoln addresses the impact of the draft and high bounties for army recruits on the naval service, suggesting that Congress could take action to aid both the army and naval services through a definitive provision that would be equitable to the communities involved (Text #: 68). This passage underscores the significance of the naval blockade in the context of the larger military strategy employed by the Union during the Civil War.

Throughout his speeches, Lincoln consistently emphasizes the importance of the naval blockade in maintaining the Union, preventing foreign intervention, and securing victory in the Civil War.
