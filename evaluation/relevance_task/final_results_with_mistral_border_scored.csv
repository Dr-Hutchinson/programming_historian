"How important were border states like Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri during the Civil War?",Text #: 42,"Yet none of the States commonly called Slavestates, except Delaware, gave a Regiment through regular State organization. A few regiments have been organized within some others of those states, by individual enterprise, and received into the government service. Of course the seceded States, so called, (and to which Texas had been joined about the time of the inauguration,) gave no troops to the cause of the Union. The border States, so called, were not uniform in their actions; some of them being almost for the Union, while in others---as Virginia, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas---the Union sentiment was nearly repressed, and silenced. The course taken in Virginia was the most remarkable---perhaps the most important. A convention, elected by the people of that State, to consider this very question of disrupting the Federal Union, was in session at the capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell. To this body the people had chosen a large majority of professed Union men.","Source:  July 4th Message to Congress. July 4, 1861.","Summary: In his July 4 Message to Congress, Abraham Lincoln discusses the response of various states to the call for troops to support the Union. While the response was generally gratifying, the so-called ""slave states"" and border states had mixed reactions. Virginia's actions were particularly noteworthy, as they allowed the insurrection to take root within their borders, seizing the United States Armory and Navy-yard, and aligning themselves with the Confederate States. The concept of ""armed neutrality"" in border states is criticized as effectively supporting disunion. Despite potential legal questions surrounding the government's actions, such as issuing calls for volunteers and closing ports, Lincoln trusts that Congress will ratify these measures as they are believed to be within their constitutional competency."," call for troops, slave states, border states, Virginia, insurrection, armed neutrality, disunion, constitutional competency, Congress.",Qdrant,,,0.5625305313894297,1.0,,,-2.9023538,1.0,92%,"Relevant

3. Contextual Relevance: In this excerpt from Lincoln's July 4th Message to Congress, he discusses the role of border states, such as Virginia, during the early stages of the Civil War. These states were crucial because they held the power to either join the Confederacy or remain loyal to the Union. Virginia's decision to hold a convention to consider the question of secession was significant, as it occurred just before Fort Sumter fell, marking the beginning of the war. Lincoln highlights the importance of these border states in maintaining the Union, as some of them, like Virginia, had a large number of Union supporters despite the strong pro-slavery sentiments present in the region.",1,1,1

Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly, and, I think, unchangeably, ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet; and I believe cannot again be overrun by the insurrectionists.

He highlights the patriotic spirit of the people and the abundant natural resources of these territories, and commends their interests and defense to Congress. Lincoln also addresses the interests of the District of Columbia, which has suffered due to the insurrection. He mentions efforts to represent the industrial interests of the United States at the London exhibition in 1862, and the issue of confiscated property and freed slaves. The President proposes a plan for colonizing freed slaves and possibly free colored people already in the country, which may involve acquiring territory and appropriating funds. He emphasizes the importance of preserving the Union and using all indispensable means to achieve that goal.

He argues that the repeal, along with its principle, is intrinsically wrong and unjust. Lincoln uses the metaphor of two starving men dividing a loaf of bread to illustrate the unfairness of reopening the territories to the introduction of slavery. He also refutes the argument that slavery will not spread to Kansas and Nebraska due to climate or other factors, and suggests that the presence of slavery in a territory will likely lead to its legalization."," Abraham Lincoln, Missouri Compromise, repeal, unjust, slavery, Kansas, Nebraska, climate, territory, legislation, unfairness, metaphor, legalization.",ColBERT,,,,,18.5625,3.0,-4.193212,2.0,81%,"Relevant

"How important were border states like Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri during the Civil War?",Text #: 61,"No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass, by writing it down on paper, or parchment, as a national boundary.
