Abraham Lincoln's speeches offer insight into his evolving stance on slavery and emancipation throughout his presidency. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln emphasized his commitment to preserving the existing state of affairs regarding slavery, stating, "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so" (March 4, 1861).

However, as the Civil War progressed, Lincoln's views on slavery began to shift. In his Third Annual Message, he highlighted the role of African Americans in the Union army and the positive impact of their enlistment on both the labor front and the morale of the Union cause. He noted that "of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, full one hundred thousand are now in the United States military service" (December 8, 1863).

Lincoln's earlier opposition to slavery can be seen in his eulogy for Henry Clay, where he quoted Clay's belief that "the negroes were to be excepted from the human race" (July 6, 1852). In his Cooper Union Address, Lincoln acknowledged the limited role of the federal government in emancipation while emphasizing its ability to prevent the spread of slavery. He advocated for a gradual approach to addressing the issue, aiming for peaceful transition and replacement of enslaved labor with free labor (February 27, 1860).

By the time of his Fourth Annual Message, Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation, and he reaffirmed his commitment to its principles. He declared, "I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that ‘‘while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress.’'' (December 6, 1864).

Throughout his speeches, Lincoln's evolving stance on slavery and emancipation reflects the complexity of the issue and the political challenges he faced during his presidency.
