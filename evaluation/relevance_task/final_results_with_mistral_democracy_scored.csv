How did Lincoln regard democracy as a form of government?,Text #: 41,"Then, and thereby, the assailants of the Government, began the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight, or in expectancy, to return their fire, save only the few in the Fort, sent to that harbor, years before, for their own protection, and still ready to give that protection, in whatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country, the distinct issue: Immediate dissolution, or blood.'' And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States. It presents to the whole family of man, the question, whether a constitutional republic, or a democracy---a government of the people, by the same people---can, or cannot, maintain its territorial integrity, against its own domestic foes. It presents the question, whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration, according to organic law, in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this case, or on any other pretences, or arbitrarily, without any pretence, break up their Government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. It forces us to ask: Is there, in all republics, this inherent, and fatal weakness?'' ``Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?''","Source:  July 4th Message to Congress. July 4, 1861.","Summary: In Abraham Lincoln's July 4 Message to Congress in 1861, he discusses the difficult decision-making process surrounding the events at Fort Sumter. Abandoning the fort was seen as ruinous, as it would discourage Union supporters, embolden adversaries, and potentially lead to foreign recognition of the Confederacy. Lincoln explains that reinforcing Fort Pickens was prioritized to demonstrate the government's resolve. He emphasizes that the assault on Fort Sumter was not an act of self-defense by the assailants, as the government's intentions were merely to maintain visible possession of the fort to preserve the Union. The conflict at Fort Sumter forced the country to face the issue of immediate dissolution or bloodshed, which also raised questions about the viability of a constitutional republic in maintaining territorial integrity against domestic foes."," Fort Sumter, Fort Pickens, ruinous, reinforcement, assault, self-defense, dissolution, bloodshed, constitutional republic, territorial integrity.",ColBERT,,,,,13.7890625,1.0,0.7372105,1.0,92%,"Relevant

How did Lincoln regard democracy as a form of government?,Text #: 29,"I fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse. I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry: ""What was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned?"" What is the frame of government under which we live? The answer must be: ""The Constitution of the United States."" That Constitution consists of the original, framed in 1787, (and under which the present government first went into operation,) and twelve subsequently framed amendments, the first ten of which were framed in 1789.

Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution?

He refers to a statement by Stephen Douglas and uses it as a starting point for examining the actions of the founding fathers, who framed the Constitution, on this matter. By analyzing their votes in the Congress of the Confederation and the first Congress under the Constitution, Lincoln shows that many of the founding fathers believed the Federal Government could control slavery in federal territories."," Cooper Union Speech, Abraham Lincoln, founding fathers, Constitution, Stephen Douglas, slavery, federal territories, Congress of the Confederation, local and federal authority, Ordinance of '87.",Qdrant,,,0.5273760416403753,1.0,,,-4.2966495,2.0,88%,"Relevant

How did Lincoln regard democracy as a form of government?,Text #: 9,"I say this is the leading principle---the sheet anchor of American republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence says:

``We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.'' I have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to our ancient faith, the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed. Now the relation of masters and slaves is, PRO TANTO, a total violation of this principle. The master not only governs the slave without his consent; but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself. Allow ALL the governed an equal voice in the government, and that, and that only is self government.","Source:  At Peoria, Illinois. October 16, 1854.","Summary: In this passage, Abraham Lincoln addresses the argument of self-government in relation to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. He asserts that the concept of self-government is fundamentally right but questions its application to the issue of slavery. Lincoln argues that true self-government cannot exist when one person governs another without consent. He cites the Declaration of Independence as the basis of this belief, stating that the just powers of governments come from the consent of the governed. He clarifies that he is not advocating for political and social equality between whites and blacks, but rather arguing against the extension of slavery into new territories. Finally, he discusses the opinions and examples of the founding fathers, asserting that their support for self-government did not extend to carrying slavery into new territories."," Abraham Lincoln, speech, self-government, Missouri Compromise, slavery, consent, Declaration of Independence, founding fathers, American republicanism, new territories, despotism, moral argument.",Qdrant,,,0.5216049620276026,2.0,,,-4.5815525,3.0,81%,"Relevant

How did Lincoln regard democracy as a form of government?,Text #: 70,"Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the States wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing is attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The man is only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath. The Constitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion; and this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities.","Source:  Third Annual Message.

This is essentially a People's contest. On the side of the Union, it is a struggle for maintaining in the world, that form, and substance of government, whose leading object is, to elevate the condition of men---to lift artificial weights from all shoulders---to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all---to afford all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life. Yielding to partial, and temporary departures, from necessity, this is the leading object of the government for whose existence we contend. I am most happy to believe that the plain people understand, and appreciate this. It is worthy of note, that while in this, the government's hour of trial, large numbers of those in the Army and Navy, who have been favored with the offices, have resigned, and proved false to the hand which had pampered them, not one common soldier, or common sailor is is known to have deserted his flag.
