How did Lincoln regard John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry?,Text #: 32,"If you would have the peace of the old times, readopt the precepts and policy of the old times. You charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves. We deny it; and what is your proof? Harper's Ferry! John Brown!! John Brown was no Republican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his Harper's Ferry enterprise.

February 27, 1860.","Summary: Summary: In Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, he addresses the Southern people and defends the Republican party's stance on slavery, arguing that their beliefs align with those of the founding fathers. He denies the accusation of the Republicans being sectional and insists that they follow the old policy of prohibiting the extension of slavery. Lincoln also refutes the claim that Republicans stir up insurrections among slaves, using the example of John Brown and Harper's Ferry to show that no Republican was implicated."," Abraham Lincoln, Cooper Union speech, founding fathers, slavery, Republican party, sectional, old policy, Southern people, prohibition, insurrections, John Brown, Harper's Ferry",ColBERT,,,,,22.359375,1.0,-0.5825447,1.0,92%,"Relevant

3. Contextual Relevance: In his Cooper Union Address, Lincoln distanced the Republican Party from John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, emphasizing that no Republicans were involved in the incident. This statement served to counter accusations made by opponents that the Republican Party was instigating slave rebellions. By clarifying the Party's stance on the issue, Lincoln aimed to quell fears of a violent upheaval and maintain focus on the political issues driving the growing tensions between the North and South.",1,1,1
How did Lincoln regard John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry?,Text #: 42,"Whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault upon Sumter, or their great resentment at the government's resistance to that assault, is not definitely known. Although they submitted the ordinance, for ratification, to vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more than a month distant, the convention, and the Legislature, (Which was also in session at the same time and place) with leading men of the State, not members of either, immediately commenced acting, as if the State were already out of the Union. They pushed military preparations vigorously forward all over the state. They seized the United States Armory at Harper's Ferry, and the Navy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk. They received---perhaps invited---into their state, large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments, from the so-called seceded States. They formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance, and co-operation with the so-called Confederate States,'' and sent members to their Congress at Montgomery. And, finally, they permitted the insurrectionary government to be transferred to their capital at Richmond.","Source:  July 4th Message to Congress. July 4, 1861.","Summary: In his July 4 Message to Congress, Abraham Lincoln discusses the response of various states to the call for troops to support the Union. While the response was generally gratifying, the so-called ""slave states"" and border states had mixed reactions. Virginia's actions were particularly noteworthy, as they allowed the insurrection to take root within their borders, seizing the United States Armory and Navy-yard, and aligning themselves with the Confederate States. The concept of ""armed neutrality"" in border states is criticized as effectively supporting disunion. Despite potential legal questions surrounding the government's actions, such as issuing calls for volunteers and closing ports, Lincoln trusts that Congress will ratify these measures as they are believed to be within their constitutional competency."," call for troops, slave states, border states, Virginia, insurrection, armed neutrality, disunion, constitutional competency, Congress.",ColBERT,,,,,17.390625,2.0,-2.0177376,2.0,85%,"Relevant

3. Contextual Relevance: In this excerpt from Lincoln's July 4th Message to Congress, he discusses the events leading up to several states seceding from the Union. He mentions the seizure of federal installations like the US Armory at Harper's Ferry and the Navy-yard at Gosport as part of their preparations for separation. These actions occurred after John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in October 1859, which served as a catalyst for heightened tensions between the North and South. Thus, while the quote does not directly mention John Brown's raid, it provides crucial context regarding the role the incident played in the escalating crisis that led to the Civil War.",1,1,1
How did Lincoln regard John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry?,Text #: 33,"""Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper's Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results.

February 27, 1860.","Summary: In this excerpt of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union Speech, he addresses the accusations that Republican doctrines and declarations lead to events like the Harper's Ferry raid. He argues that slaves do not hear their declarations and that slave insurrections are not a result of Republican influence. Lincoln highlights the differences between John Brown's actions and a slave insurrection, stating that both were philosophically similar to attempts at assassinating kings and emperors. He emphasizes that breaking up the Republican organization will not change the judgment and sentiment against slavery, and he denies that there is a constitutional right to take and hold slaves in federal territories."," Cooper Union Speech, Republican doctrines, Harper's Ferry, slave insurrections, John Brown, sentiment against slavery, federal territories, constitutional right, assassination attempts.""",BM25,31.333923398384098,1.0,,,,,-4.8690033,3.0,85%,"Relevant

How did Lincoln regard John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry?,Text #: 41,"An order was at once directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the Steamship Brooklyn, into Fort Pickens. This order could not go by land, but must take the longer, and slower route by sea. The first return news from the order was received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter. The news itself was, that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some quasi armistice of the late administration, (and of the existence of which, the present administration, up to the time the order was despatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors, to fix attention) had refused to land the troops. To now re-inforce Fort Pickens, before a crisis would be
reached at Fort Sumter was impossible---rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named Fort. In precaution against such a conjuncture, the government had, a few days before, commenced preparing an expedition, as well adapted as might be, to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to be ultimately used, or not, according to circumstances. The strongest anticipated case, for using it, was now presented; and it was resolved to send it forward.","Source:  July 4th Message to Congress. July 4, 1861.","Summary: In Abraham Lincoln's July 4 Message to Congress in 1861, he discusses the difficult decision-making process surrounding the events at Fort Sumter. Abandoning the fort was seen as ruinous, as it would discourage Union supporters, embolden adversaries, and potentially lead to foreign recognition of the Confederacy. Lincoln explains that reinforcing Fort Pickens was prioritized to demonstrate the government's resolve. He emphasizes that the assault on Fort Sumter was not an act of self-defense by the assailants, as the government's intentions were merely to maintain visible possession of the fort to preserve the Union. The conflict at Fort Sumter forced the country to face the issue of immediate dissolution or bloodshed, which also raised questions about the viability of a constitutional republic in maintaining territorial integrity against domestic foes."," Fort Sumter, Fort Pickens, ruinous, reinforcement, assault, self-defense, dissolution, bloodshed, constitutional republic, territorial integrity.",Qdrant,,,0.3941543006719983,2.0,,,-6.2535977,4.0,77%,"Irrelevant.

How did Lincoln regard John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry?,Text #: 73,"The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as, and cannot be more earnest than our own. Nevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and British ports, and on the northern boundary of the United States, which have required, and are likely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance, and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States as well as of the nations concerned and their governments. Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain on the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them. In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons, who are harbored there, it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the lakes, if they shall find that proceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th of June, 1854. I desire, however, to be understood, while making this statement, that the Colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly towards the United States; but, on the contrary, there is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the imperial government, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border. The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of emigration has, so far as was possible, been put into operation.","Source:  Fourth Annual Message.

How did Lincoln regard John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry?,Text #: 31,"""For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however distinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the ""thirty-nine"" even, on any other phase of the general question of slavery. If we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave trade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all, would probably have acted just as the twenty-three did. Among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti-slavery men of those times - as Dr. Franklin, Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris - while there was not one now known to have been otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South Carolina. The sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution, twenty-one - a clear majority of the whole - certainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control slavery in the federal territories; while all the rest probably had the same understanding.","Source:  Cooper Union Address.
