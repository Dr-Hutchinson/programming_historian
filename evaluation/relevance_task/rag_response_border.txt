Abraham Lincoln's speeches reveal the critical role border states like Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri played during the Civil War. In his July 4th Message to Congress in 1861, Lincoln discussed the importance of Virginia, particularly its convention that met when Fort Sumter fell, which could have determined whether the state would join the Confederacy or remain loyal to the Union. He noted that the course taken in Virginia was "the most remarkableâ€”perhaps the most important" (Text #: 42).

Moreover, in his First Annual Message on December 3, 1861, Lincoln highlighted the significant military contributions of these border states, which initially promised no troops but now had an aggregate of forty thousand soldiers in the field for the Union (Text #: 52). He also mentioned that Kentucky, Missouri, and Maryland were producing reasonably fair crops, allowing the Union to maintain control of these agriculturally rich regions (Text #: 76).

Lincoln's speeches also emphasized the strategic importance of these states in terms of geography and population. In his Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862, he described the interior region, which included parts of Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, as the "great body of the republic," containing more than one-third of the country owned by the United States and over thirty million people (Text #: 61).

In conclusion, Lincoln's speeches underscored the importance of border states like Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri during the Civil War. Their strategic significance lay in their large populations, vast territorial expanses, and their role as crucial battlegrounds in the struggle over the extension of slavery. By maintaining control of these areas, the Union was able to secure key victories and ultimately emerge victorious in the war.
