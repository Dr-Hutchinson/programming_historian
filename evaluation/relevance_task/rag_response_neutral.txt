Abraham Lincoln's speeches and messages reveal a nuanced understanding of the role of neutral nations like England and France during the American Civil War. In his Fourth Annual Message on December 6, 1864, Lincoln expresses satisfaction with the maintenance of neutrality towards these countries, stating, "At the same time, we have strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents" (Text #: 72). This neutral stance enabled the United States to continue trading with these nations, ensuring economic stability amidst the conflict.

In his Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862, Lincoln acknowledges the challenges posed by neutral nations recognizing the Confederacy as a belligerent power. He expresses hope that these nations would eventually reverse their positions, but notes that temporary setbacks on the battlefield had hindered this outcome (Text #: 57). Despite these challenges, Lincoln remains optimistic that the US would eventually emerge stronger once the domestic conflict was resolved.

Moreover, Lincoln's speeches highlight the importance of maintaining diplomatic relations with other neutral nations, such as Japan, during the Civil War. In his Second Annual Message, he mentions the pursuit of commercial treaties with Liberia and Haiti, as well as the maintenance of favorable relations with various European powers and Japan (Text #: 58). These relationships proved crucial in maintaining international support for the Union cause and preventing foreign intervention in the conflict.

Overall, Lincoln's speeches demonstrate a pragmatic approach to managing the diplomatic landscape during the Civil War, balancing the need to suppress the rebellion with the importance of maintaining neutrality and pursuing diplomatic relations with other nations.
