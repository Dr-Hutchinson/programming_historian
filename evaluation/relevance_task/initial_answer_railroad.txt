Abraham Lincoln's presidency played a significant role in the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, although it was not directly responsible for its initiation or construction. The railroad project began during the administration of John Tyler in 1849 with the passage of the Pacific Railway Act. However, due to various economic and political challenges, progress on the eastern and western halves of the railroad stalled.

Lincoln's influence on the project came primarily through his support for the land grants that provided the financial incentives necessary for private investors to invest in the railroad. In 1862, during the height of the American Civil War, Congress passed the Land-Grant Pacification Bill, also known as the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act. This legislation granted federal lands to states on the condition that they establish colleges dedicated to agriculture and mechanical arts. The surplus revenue from these sales was then used by the federal government to fund internal improvements such as roads, canals, and later, railroads.

The Revised Pacific Railroad Act of 1862, which became part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, granted 30 million acres (approximately 121,427 square kilometers) of public land to the Central Pacific Railroad Company for constructing the western half of the transcontinental line, while the Union Pacific Railroad Company received similar land grants for building the eastern half. These land grants significantly reduced the cost of construction for both companies and served as crucial financing mechanisms.

Additionally, Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War ensured the stability of the nation, allowing resources and labor to be directed towards the railroad project. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 marked an essential milestone in American history, connecting the East and West coasts and greatly enhancing transportation infrastructure.
