Abraham Lincoln's speeches reveal his deep commitment to the development and expansion of the United States, including the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. While his speeches do not directly mention the railroad by name, they touch upon themes related to westward expansion, unity, and the role of the government in shaping the nation.

In his speech at Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, 1854, Lincoln discussed the potential transformation of the concept of popular sovereignty into a "sacred right" and the evolving role of the United States as a leading nation. He envisioned the future extension of the country and the potential for the railroad to play a significant role in connecting the East and West (Text #: 14).

Moreover, in his eulogy for Henry Clay on July 6, 1852, Lincoln expressed his belief in the potential redemption of Africa and its people, which could be seen as a precursor to the eventual emancipation of slaves in the United States and the subsequent migration of freed slaves to Africa via the United States Colonization Society (Text #: 27).

Although the railroad itself is not explicitly mentioned in these speeches, the themes of westward expansion, unity, and the role of the government in shaping the nation provide context for understanding Lincoln's perspective on the importance of infrastructure projects like the Transcontinental Railroad in the development of the United States.
