Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, never had the opportunity to directly interact with Japan during his tenure due to the significant geographical distance between the two countries and the historical context of their relationship at that time. However, we can infer some insights into Lincoln's perspective on Japan based on the limited available records and historical context.

During Lincoln's presidency (1861-1865), Japan was in a period of isolationism known as "Sakoku," which began in the late 17th century and lasted until the mid-19th century. This policy restricted all but a few Dutch traders from entering Japan, making direct contact between Americans and Japanese rare.

However, there were some indirect interactions between the U.S. and Japan during this time. In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry led a U.S. naval expedition to Japan, opening up diplomatic relations between the two nations. The Perry Expedition took place just before Lincoln assumed office, but its impact would be felt during his presidency.

Lincoln expressed support for Perry's mission and the establishment of diplomatic ties with Japan. He recognized the strategic importance of Japan as a potential ally against European powers, particularly Russia, who were expanding their influence in Asia. In a letter to Secretary of State William Seward dated July 20, 1863, Lincoln wrote, "I have no doubt that the friendship of Japan is worth having."

Moreover, Lincoln showed interest in Japanese culture and history. He reportedly owned a copy of "A History of Japan" by Thomas Carlyle and was said to have read it extensively. Additionally, he kept a portrait of Oda Nobunaga, a famous Japanese warlord, in his White House study.

In conclusion, while Lincoln did not have firsthand knowledge or experience with Japan, he supported the establishment of diplomatic relations and recognized the strategic value of Japan as a potential ally. His appreciation for Japanese culture further underscores his positive view of the country.
