Abraham Lincoln regarded John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry as an isolated incident that did not involve the Republican Party. In his Cooper Union Address on February 27, 1860, Lincoln explicitly stated, "John Brown was no Republican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his Harper's Ferry enterprise" (Text #: 32). This statement was made in response to accusations that the Republican Party was instigating slave rebellions.

However, the raid on Harper's Ferry did contribute to the growing tensions between the North and South, as evidenced by the events following the raid. In his July 4th Message to Congress on July 4, 1861, Lincoln mentioned the seizure of federal installations like the US Armory at Harper's Ferry and the Navy-yard at Gosport as part of the preparations for secession by several states (Text #: 42). These actions occurred shortly after the raid, and the heightened tensions ultimately led to the Civil War.

Despite the connection between John Brown's raid and the secession crisis, Lincoln maintained that the Republican Party did not condone or encourage such violent acts. In his Cooper Union Address, he emphasized that the party's beliefs and principles were consistent with those of the Founding Fathers (Text #: 33). This perspective allowed Lincoln to distance the Republican Party from the raid while addressing the concerns of those who believed the party's doctrines and declarations led to such outcomes.
