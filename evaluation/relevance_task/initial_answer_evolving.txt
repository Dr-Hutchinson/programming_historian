Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, is well-known for his role in preserving the Union and for his unwavering commitment to ending slavery. However, it's essential to understand that Lincoln's views on slavery and emancipation evolved over time, reflecting the political climate and the exigencies of the moment.

Lincoln's earliest public statements on slavery were moderate and focused primarily on maintaining the Union. In his 1835 Illinois Black Laws speech, he argued against extending slavery into new territories but also expressed opposition to interfering with the institution where it already existed. This position was consistent with the Whig Party platform at the time.

However, as tensions between the North and South grew, so too did Lincoln's opposition to slavery. In his 1845 debates with Stephen Douglas, he criticized the expansion of slavery and advocated for its containment within existing slave states. He believed that allowing new territories to decide their own fate through popular sovereignty would lead to an endless cycle of expansion and conflict.

In the late 1850s, as the issue of slavery came to a head, Lincoln became increasingly vocal in his opposition. In his famous "House Divided" speech in 1858, he declared, "A house divided against itself cannot stand." Here, he warned that if we could not agree on the moral question of slavery, the country would eventually split apart.

With the election of Lincoln in 1860, which many saw as a threat to slavery, seven southern states seceded from the Union. In response, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. This executive order applied only to areas still in rebellion, excluding border states like Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, and Delaware, where significant numbers of slaves lived but had not yet seceded. It was not until later, with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, that slavery was abolished throughout the entire nation.

Throughout these years, Lincoln's speeches revealed his growing understanding of the immorality of slavery and his determination to end it. From his early calls for containing its spread to his ultimate decision to free the slaves, Lincoln's evolution on this issue mirrored the changing political landscape of the time.
